- Minimal manual intervention
- Customer satisfaction
- Templates are reusable

### 🔵 PHASE 3: "Site in a Day" Service (MONTH 2-3)
**Goal:** High-margin service using Otto

**Offer:**
- "Describe your site, I build it in 24-48 hours"
- Price: $2,500-$6,000 per site
- Market: Local network, online, referrals

**What This Validates:**
- Market demand
- Pricing acceptance
- Service delivery model
- Customer satisfaction

**Revenue Potential:**

- Validate demand before productizing
- Fund product development
- Build customer base

**Success Criteria:**

- Profitable at this price point

---

### 🟣 PHASE 4: Decision Point (MONTH 3-4)
**Goal:** Choose path based on real data

**Questions to Answer:**
- Do customers want the service or the tool?
- What features do they actually need?
- What's the right pricing model?
- Is there enough demand?

**Possible Outcomes:**
1. **Build SaaS** - If demand is strong
2. **Scale Service** - If they want you to run it
3. **Hybrid** - Service + self-serve product
4. **Pivot** - Different model based on learnings

---

### 🟤 PHASE 5: Otto SaaS Product (MONTH 4-6+)
**Goal:** Scale to mass market

**Only if Phase 4 validates:**
- Build frontend UI
- Add billing system
- Template marketplace
- Multi-tenant support

**This is the big play** - but only AFTER validation.

## 💰 Revenue While Building

**Even before productizing:**

**Month 1-2:**
- 2-3 sites @ $2,500-$5,000 = $7,500-$15,000

**Month 2-3:**
- 5-10 sites @ $2,500-$6,000 = $12,500-$60,000

**Total Potential:**
- $20,000-$75,000 in 3 months
- Validate demand
- Fund product development
- Build reputation

**This is WAY safer than:**
- Building product nobody wants
- Launching to crickets
- Spending months on unused features
