## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Tell Frat:**

---

> "Frat, your phased plan is solid. I agree with the approach: validate first, then productize.
>
> **Priority #1: Finish catered-by-me billing endpoints.**
>
> I checked the codebase — the billing endpoints (`/billing/checkout` and `/billing/webhook`) aren't implemented yet. The control doc exists, Stripe is configured, but the actual code needs to be written.
>
> **Once billing is done:**
> 1. Catered-by-me will be 100% complete
> 2. Then we'll build the template system
> 3. Then we'll build 2-3 test sites
> 4. Then we'll launch the 'Site in a Day' service
> 5. Then we'll decide on product based on real data
>
> **About the OTTO logo:** Yes, let's do it. But let's get a good version quickly, use it, and refine later. Don't perfect it for weeks.
>
> **About the SaaS:** I agree — validate with service first, then build product if demand is there. Don't assume we need to productize. Let the data decide.
>
> **What should we prioritize right now?**
> 1. Finish billing for catered-by-me (1-2 days)
> 2. Then build template system (1 week)
> 3. Then build test sites (2-3 weeks)
> 4. Then launch service (month 2)
>
> This balances ambition with pragmatism. What do you think?"

## 🎯 Or Shorter Version

**Tell Frat:**

> "Frat, your plan is good. Let's do Priority #1: Finish catered-by-me billing endpoints (they're not implemented yet). Once that's done, we're 100% ready. Then templates → test sites → service → decide on product. Sound good?"

---

## 🎯 Key Points

✅ **Agree with:** Phased approach, service first, validate before productizing  
✅ **Add:** Billing endpoints need to be implemented first  
✅ **Emphasize:** Finish catered-by-me completely before moving on  
✅ **Clarify:** Logo = yes, but don't perfect it for weeks  
✅ **Reinforce:** Let data guide product decisions

---

**Bottom line:** Frat's plan is solid. Just need to finish billing first, then follow the plan.
