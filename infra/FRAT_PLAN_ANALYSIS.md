## ⚠️ What to Watch Out For

### 1. **Timeline Optimism**
**Frat says:** Phase 5 in Month 4-6  
**Reality check:**
- Service delivery takes time
- Template building takes time
- Customer feedback loops take time
- Product development takes time

**More realistic:** Phase 5 is Month 6-12, not Month 4-6.

**This is fine!** Service revenue funds it anyway.

---

### 2. **Service vs. Product Confusion**
**Frat says:** Launch service, then build product  
**Reality check:**
- If service works GREAT, why productize?
- Service = higher margins, lower scale
- Product = lower margins, higher scale
- Both are valid businesses!

**Recommendation:** Don't assume you NEED to productize. Let the data decide.

---

### 3. **Template Complexity**
**Frat says:** Build templates for different projects  
**Reality check:**
- Each template needs testing
- Each template has edge cases
- Maintenance burden grows quickly
- 3-5 templates is enough to start

**Recommendation:** Start with 2-3 templates, not 10.

---

### 4. **Support Burden**
**Frat says:** Otto IS support  
**Reality check:**
- Otto helps, but doesn't eliminate support
- Customers need human help sometimes
- Edge cases require manual intervention
- Documentation needs constant updates

**Recommendation:** Plan for support time (10-20% of service delivery).

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### **Start with: "Finish catered-by-me"**

**This gives you:**

**Then launch service** (validates demand, generates revenue)

**Then decide on product** (based on real data)

---

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't:
1. **Build SaaS UI yet** — Too early, no validation
2. **Build 10 templates** — Start with 2-3
3. **Spend weeks on logo** — Get good version, refine later
4. **Skip validation steps** — Service revenue proves demand
5. **Rush to productize** — Let data guide you

### ✅ Do:
1. **Finish catered-by-me** — Complete what you started
2. **Build template system** — Foundation for scaling
3. **Test with real projects** — Validate before productizing
4. **Launch service** — Generate revenue while building
5. **Let data decide** — Product vs. service vs. both

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Frat's plan is solid.** The phased approach is smart.

**My recommendation:**
1. ✅ Finish catered-by-me (this week)
2. ✅ Build template system (next week)
3. ✅ Build 2-3 test sites (weeks 2-4)
4. ✅ Launch service (month 2)
5. ✅ Then decide based on data

**This balances ambition with pragmatism.**

**And yes, build the OTTO logo — just don't let it block progress.**
