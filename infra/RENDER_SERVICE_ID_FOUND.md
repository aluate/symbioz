# ✅ Render Service ID Found!

## 🎉 Success!

I found your Render service ID by querying the Render API directly!

**Service ID:** `srv-d4kcjnali9vc73dm82v0`

**Service Name:** `catered_by_me`

**Details:**
- Type: Web Service
- Repo: `https://github.com/aluate/catered_by_me`
- Branch: `main`

## ✅ Updated Config File

I've updated `infra/providers/render.yaml` with your service ID:

```yaml
render_service_id: "srv-d4kcjnali9vc73dm82v0"
```

## 🎯 What This Means

Now Otto can:
- ✅ Check your Render service status
- ✅ View deployment logs
- ✅ Monitor service health
- ✅ Get deployment information

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Render Service ID** - DONE!
2. ⏳ **Stripe** - Skip for now (as you said)
3. ❌ **Vercel Deployment** - Still needs fixing (the real blocker)

---

**Otto can now fully monitor your Render service!** 🎉
