# 💡 My Honest Recommendation

**Date:** November 30, 2025  
**Context:** Frat's plan + Devil's Advocate analysis

---

## 🎯 What Frat Got Right

1. ✅ **The phased approach is smart** - Validate, then productize
2. ✅ **Revenue while building** - Service model funds product development
3. ✅ **The vision is solid** - Otto can become a real product
4. ✅ **The branding plan is good** - OTTO owl logo is memorable
5. ✅ **The technical foundation is strong** - You've built something real

---

## ⚠️ What to Watch Out For

### 1. **Don't Skip Validation**
- Frat's plan includes validation (good!)
- But don't rush Phase 5 just because Phase 3 works
- Make sure you have REAL customer feedback before building SaaS

### 2. **Service vs. Product Confusion**
- If "Site in a Day" service works great, that might BE the product
- You don't HAVE to build a self-serve SaaS
- Service businesses can scale too (agencies, teams, systems)

### 3. **Template Debt**
- Building 2-3 sites quickly is good
- But don't create 10 different templates without patterns
- Standardize early, or you'll have maintenance nightmares

### 4. **Support Reality**
- Service = you handle support
- Product = you need support infrastructure
- Don't underestimate support burden
