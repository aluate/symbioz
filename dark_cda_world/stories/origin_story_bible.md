# 2. Magic & Metaphysics (Origin‑Specific)

These rules **augment** the universal metaphysics.  
They apply ONLY to this era and cast.

## 2.1 The Boy’s Dual Burden
- He holds both Coin and Pouch.
- This era defines how the **Keeper/Spender** duality originates.
- Emotional instability causes physical imbalance.

## 2.2 Sela’s Overload
- Her gift is still developing.
- Overloading causes: shaking hands, nosebleeds, memory loss, temporary silence.
- She unintentionally shields others from Weight surges.

## 2.3 Early Thin Places
Unique to this book:
- The timber circle
- The high spring where Graybreaker waits
- The split‑path clearing
- The lake that becomes the mirror

These thin places appear **before** the known geography of later eras.

## 2.4 Mother’s Voice
- Her singing steadies the boy’s pouch.
- When she is dying, her voice enters the Weight fabric and becomes a recurring echo.
