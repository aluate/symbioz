Arpin announced Sela must still be captured the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, saying "the curse lingers until the mountain sleeps," the weight remains until the poison is removed, the scales tip until the corruption is destroyed, the something builds until the weight is ended.

"The curse lingers," he shouted. "The weight remains. The scales tip. The something builds. And they will keep lingering, keep remaining, keep tipping, keep building, until the mountain sleeps, until the poison is removed, until the corruption is destroyed, until the weight is ended. And she must be found. She must be captured. She must be brought back. She must be given up. She must be betrayed. She must be broken. She must be destroyed. She must be ended."

His men scoured the woods that day, pressing Boone to lead them, their movements quick, their voices low, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The trio prowled the edges—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—their silent menace sealing the woods, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac whispered to Boone that evening, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying "Family betrays family. It is the oldest law," the weight shifts, the scales tip, the balance breaks, the something comes, something that will break, something that will change, something that will end everything.

"Family betrays family," Isaac whispered. "It is the oldest law. The weight shifts. The scales tip. The balance breaks. The something comes. And you, Boone? You will betray. You will break. You will shift. You will tip. You will come. You will lead them. You will show them. You will give her up. You will betray her. You will break her. You will destroy her. You will end her. Because that's the oldest law. That's the weight. That's the scale. That's the balance. That's the something that comes, that breaks, that changes, that ends everything."

Boone broke then, hinting at Sela's trail, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin led the posse himself that evening, coin thrumming in Isaac's pocket, villagers whipped into frenzy, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Sela evaded them through gullies and underbrush that night, slipping into the mountain's shadow but running out of ground, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman rushed back toward Shadow that night, too late—torches already weaving through the trees like a net, their light bright, their movements quick, their voices low, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried to misdirect the posse in small ways that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were shoved aside, their voices silenced, their movements stopped, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

For the first time, the mountain groaned loud enough to knock stones from its slopes that night, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight follows. The weight always follows. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
