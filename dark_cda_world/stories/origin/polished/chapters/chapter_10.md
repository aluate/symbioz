# Chapter 10

The rumors started two days after the fissure opened. Someone had found a wolf on the outskirts, dead, its mouth foaming, its eyes clouded. Then another. Then an elk, staggering and dropping mid-step, its legs giving out beneath it. The animals were sick, dying, and no one knew why.

Taman heard about it from Boone, who'd been at the edge of the settlement, checking the perimeter, making sure everything was secure. His expression was troubled, his voice low, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down.

"They're just sick," Boone said. "It happens. Animals get sick. They die. It's natural. Nothing to worry about."

But Taman had seen the animals. He'd seen the way they moved, the way they staggered, the way they dropped. It wasn't natural. It wasn't normal. Something was wrong, something that went deeper than sickness, something that felt like weight, like imbalance, like the scales tipping too far.

Arpin called the settlement together that afternoon, his expression calm, reasonable. "I've heard the rumors," he said, his voice carrying across the yard. "I've heard about the animals. And I want to put your minds at ease. This is nonsense. Animals get sick. They die. It's natural. Nothing to worry about."

But even as he spoke, his men were moving, seizing the carcasses, dragging them away for disposal. They moved quickly, efficiently, as if they'd done this before, as if they knew what to do. And Isaac stood at Arpin's side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin, and Taman felt the shift in the air, that wrongness he'd learned to recognize—the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"The animals are being taken care of," Arpin said. "The carcasses are being disposed of. There's nothing to worry about. Everything is under control."

The crowd nodded, relieved, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. They believed Arpin. They trusted him. They didn't see the way his men moved, the way they seized the carcasses, the way Isaac's coin made everything feel inevitable.

That evening, Taman found Sela at the edge of the settlement, looking out toward the timber, her expression troubled.

"You've heard about the animals," she said, not a question.

Taman nodded. "Boone says it's natural. Arpin says it's nothing to worry about."

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "The weight can twist more than people, Taman. It can twist animals. It can twist the land itself. When the scales tip too far, when the imbalance becomes too great, it doesn't just affect us. It affects everything."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. The weight could twist animals. It could twist the land. And the animals were sick, dying, their mouths foaming, their legs giving out. It wasn't natural. It wasn't normal. It was weight, imbalance, the scales tipping too far.

"What do we do?" Taman asked.

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the weight from breaking. But eventually, something has to give. Something has to break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. Something has to give. Something has to break. And when it does, they'll all be caught in it. The animals were just the beginning. The weight was building, the scales were tipping, and something was coming.

That night, Taman dreamed of the animals. He saw them staggering, dropping, their mouths foaming, their eyes clouded. He saw the wolves, the elk, the way they moved, the way they died. And he felt the weight of it, the way it twisted things, the way it made everything wrong.

He woke before dawn, his heart racing, his hand on his pouch. It felt heavier now, tighter, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

He stepped outside, breathing the morning air, and that's when he saw it.

Ash.

A thin layer of it, dusting the roofs, the ground, everything. It was fine, gray, like the ash from a fire, but there was no fire. No smoke. No source. Just ash, falling from the sky, dusting everything like a funeral shroud.

Taman stood there, breathing it in, feeling the weight of it pressing down. Ash without fire. Ash from nowhere. It was a sign, a warning, a manifestation of the weight, of the imbalance, of the scales tipping too far.

The settlement began to wake, people stepping outside, seeing the ash, feeling it on their skin, in their hair, on their clothes. They moved slowly, warily, as if they knew something was wrong, as if they felt the weight of it, the way it made everything feel heavy, dangerous.

Arpin appeared in the central yard, his expression calm, reasonable. "It's just ash," he said, his voice carrying. "From the mountain, probably. Or from a fire somewhere. Nothing to worry about. It'll clear. Everything will be fine."

But the people weren't listening. They were looking at the ash, feeling it on their skin, and they knew, with a certainty that made their chests tight, that something was wrong. Something was coming. Something that would change everything.

The missionary appeared then, moving through the crowd, his expression wild, his voice carrying. "Crooked scales call crooked ends," he said, his words sharp, clear. "The weight is shifting. The imbalance is growing. And the ash is a sign, a warning, a manifestation of what's coming. Can't you see it? Can't you feel it?"

For once, nobody laughed. Nobody dismissed him. They listened, their expressions troubled, their eyes fixed on the ash, on the way it dusted everything, on the way it made the world feel wrong.

"The mountain is stirring," the missionary said. "The scales are tipping. And when they tip too far, when the weight becomes too much, the mountain will answer. The ash is just the beginning. There's more coming. More weight. More imbalance. More breaking."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. The ash was a sign. The animals were a sign. The fissure was a sign. Everything was a sign, a warning, a manifestation of the weight, of the imbalance, of the scales tipping too far.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
