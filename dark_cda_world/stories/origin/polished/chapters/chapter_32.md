# Chapter 32

Isaac watched Arpin take his "pound of flesh" from Mother in silence that night, his breathing ragged as he slunk into shadow to clean himself, whispering "balance" as if it absolved him, as if it justified him, as if it made everything right, everything fair, everything balanced.

But balance didn't absolve. Balance didn't justify. Balance didn't make things right. Balance just weighed. Balance just shifted. Balance just tipped. And every weight, every shift, every tip—it all added up. It all accumulated. It all brought the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

Arpin finished and, with chilling tenderness, cradled Mother's head, telling her the pain has been paid, the debt has been cleared, the obligation has been met, the weight has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored.

"It's done," he said, his voice soft, gentle, kind. "The pain is paid. The debt is cleared. The obligation is met. The weight is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored. And you are free. You are released. You are safe. You are protected. You are ensured. You are whole."

But she was not free. She was not released. She was not safe. She was not protected. She was not ensured. She was not whole. She was dead. She was broken. She was destroyed. She was ended. And her last words cursed him, her voice weak, her words careful, her breath coming in gasps, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Weight will find you," she whispered. "Weight will find you. Scales will find you. Truth will find you. And when it does, when it finds you, when it comes due, you will pay. You will pay for everything. You will pay for the pain. You will pay for the debt. You will pay for the obligation. You will pay for the weight. You will pay for the scale. You will pay for the balance. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Arpin killed her gently then, claiming mercy, his movements careful, his actions deliberate, his words soft, his voice kind, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone heard but did nothing, his cowardice hardening into a weight of its own, his silence becoming a debt, his inaction becoming an obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin told the town the debt is settled the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, saying the weight has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored, the something has been resolved.

But Isaac stepped forward, coin glowing faintly, insisting the mountain will keep cracking until Sela's blood feeds the scales, her weight is removed, her gift is broken, her weight is ended, her something is destroyed.

"The debt is settled," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The weight is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored. But the mountain still groans. The earth still shakes. The scales still tip. And they will keep groaning, keep shaking, keep tipping, until the weight is fully removed, until the poison is fully eliminated, until the corruption is fully destroyed, until Sela's blood feeds the scales, until her weight is removed, until her gift is broken, until her weight is ended, until her something is destroyed."

Arpin seized the turn, declaring Sela's death balance due, whipping the crowd toward frenzy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The trio flanked him then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives, their silent menace sealing the square, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain groaned audibly through the squareboards then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, and even the bravest men looked at their feet, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if the mountain itself was speaking, was judging, was promising something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight follows. The weight always follows. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
