# Chapter 37

The ritual to kill Sela was prepared in Shadow that morning—torches, drums, frenzy—the movements quick, the voices loud, the hands rough, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac told Arpin this act will cement him—the "King of Balance"—his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"This act will cement you," Isaac whispered. "This sacrifice will crown you. This weight will make you. This scale will tip you. This balance will restore you. This something will complete you. And you will be king. You will be balance. You will be everything. And everything will be yours. Everything will be under your control. Everything will be under your weight. Everything will be under your scale. Everything will be under your balance. Everything will be under your something, your building, your changing, your coming."

Arpin, drunk on power, paraded Sela before the people like a prize that afternoon, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Look," he shouted. "Look at what we have. Look at the prize. Look at the weight. Look at the scale. Look at the balance. Look at the something we've caught, we've captured, we've brought back. And now? Now we will use it. Now we will break it. Now we will destroy it. Now we will end it. And then? Then everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced. Everything will be whole."

Boone, watching, broke down, whispering apologies no one hears, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry, Sela. I'm sorry, Taman. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for betraying. I'm sorry for breaking. I'm sorry for destroying. I'm sorry for shifting. I'm sorry for tipping. I'm sorry for losing. I'm sorry for failing. I'm sorry for choosing wrong. I'm sorry for paying wrong. I'm sorry for living wrong. I'm sorry for everything. Sooner or later, I'll pay for everything."

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried in small ways to resist that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were silenced, their voices stopped, their movements halted, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe flanked Arpin then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—the town's sins given muscle, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

In the woods, Taman lost again and again in Coyote's games that day, blood dripping from his bitten tongue, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain shook that evening, splitting stones, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The sky burned an unnatural red that night, the color sharp, vivid, dangerous, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight follows. The weight always follows. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
