# Chapter 9

Three days after Hiram's beating, Arpin called the settlement together in the central yard. The sun was high overhead, and the day was warm, but Taman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. Something was coming. He could feel it in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited, in the way Arpin moved through the crowd with that smile that never reached his eyes.

"Friends," Arpin said, his voice carrying across the yard. "Neighbors. Family. I've called you here today because I have a gift for you. A gift to show you that I care, that I'm here for you, that we're all in this together."

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of his voice, by the promise of a gift. Taman watched from the edge, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd seen this before. Arpin's gifts were never free. They always came with strings, with obligations, with weight.

Isaac stood at Arpin's side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman watched him, felt the shift in the air, that wrongness he'd learned to recognize—the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Food," Arpin said, gesturing to wagons that had been brought into the yard. "Tools. Supplies. Everything you need to get through the coming months. I'm giving it to you freely, with no strings attached. Because that's what neighbors do. That's what family does. We help each other."

The crowd cheered, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. Arpin was giving them food, tools, supplies, and they were grateful. They were cheering. They were signing ledger pages, putting their names to paper, creating obligations they didn't understand.

Isaac stepped forward then, and for the first time since Hiram's beating, he pulled the coin into view. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and it caught the light like fire. He held it up, turning it slowly, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Order," Isaac said, his voice carrying across the yard. "That's what this gift represents. Order and balance. Arpin gives you what you need, and you give him your trust, your loyalty, your names. That's how balance works. That's how we stay safe."

The coin flashed in the sunlight, dazzling, hypnotic, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. Isaac was using it now, using it to bend the moment, to make the gift feel like a blessing, to make the ledger pages feel like gratitude instead of chains.

The people cheered louder, mothers weeping in gratitude, children running to the wagons, and Taman watched as they signed the ledger pages, as they put their names to paper, as they created obligations they didn't understand. Every signature was a chain. Every name was weight. And they were giving it freely, gratefully, because Isaac's coin made them feel like it was the right thing to do.

Taman felt rage building. He wanted to step forward, to speak the truth, to tell them that the gifts were chains, that the ledger pages were cages, that they were binding themselves to Arpin in ways they didn't understand. He wanted to tell them about Sela, about her gift, about the way she held weight, about the way Arpin would use her if he knew.

But he stopped himself. Speaking Sela's secret would only make things worse. It would put her in danger, put their family in danger, and it wouldn't change anything. The crowd was with Arpin, with Isaac, with the coin that promised order. They wouldn't listen. They wouldn't believe. They would only see him as a troublemaker, as someone who spoke against the gift, against the order, against the balance.

A man named Caleb stepped forward then, his expression troubled. He was a cooper, a maker of barrels, and he'd been quiet since Arpin's arrival, working his trade, keeping his head down. But something had changed. The weight was building, and Caleb had reached his limit.

"Water storage," Caleb said, his voice carrying across the yard. "We need water storage. The well is running low, and if we don't prepare, we'll be in trouble. I've been asking for months, and nothing's been done. These gifts are fine, but we need water. We need to think ahead."

Arpin's smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "Caleb," he said, his tone patient, almost condescending. "I understand your concern. But we have plenty of water. The well is fine. And these gifts"—he gestured to the wagons—"these gifts are what we need right now. Food. Tools. Supplies. That's what matters. Water storage can wait."

Caleb shook his head. "It can't wait. If we don't prepare now, we'll be in trouble later. I'm not asking for much. Just some barrels, some planning, some thought for the future."

Arpin's expression shifted, and Taman saw something dangerous in his eyes. "The future is my concern, Caleb. Not yours. You worry about your barrels. I'll worry about the settlement. That's how it works. That's how we stay organized."

A man named Silas stepped forward then, a rope in his hand. He was one of Arpin's men, one of the ones who did the dirty work, and he moved with a cruelty that made Taman's skin crawl. He grabbed Caleb's arm, dragging him away, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down.

"Let him go," Taman said, stepping forward. "He's just asking a question. He's just trying to help."

Silas looked at him, his expression cold. "Stay out of it, boy. This doesn't concern you."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to step in, wanted to do something. But before he could move, a hawk dove low over the square, its wings beating the air, scattering chickens and children, and for a moment, everything stopped.

The bird was huge, its wingspan wider than a man's reach, and it moved with a grace that was almost unnatural. It dove low, so low that Taman could see its eyes, dark and intelligent, and then it pulled up, vanishing into the sky without a sound.

The moment passed, and the crowd returned to the wagons, to the gifts, to the ledger pages. But Taman felt the weight of the hawk's presence, the way it had marked this moment, the way it had witnessed the cruelty, the way it had seen the chains being forged.

Caleb was gone, dragged away by Silas, and the crowd had already forgotten him. They were signing ledger pages, taking gifts, creating obligations, and they didn't see the chains, didn't feel the weight, didn't understand what they were doing.

Taman watched it all, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. The gifts were chains. The ledger pages were cages. And the people were binding themselves to Arpin, creating obligations they didn't understand, because Isaac's coin made them feel like it was the right thing to do.

That night, a fissure opened near the spring.

Taman heard about it the next morning, from people who'd been up early, checking the water, making sure everything was all right. They said the ground had split, a crack maybe three feet wide, running from the spring toward the mountain. And from the crack, warm mist rose, like the mountain had exhaled, like something deep and old was breathing.

Taman went to see it for himself, hiking up to the spring, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. The fissure was there, just as they'd said, a crack in the earth that shouldn't exist. And from it, warm mist rose, carrying a scent he'd never smelled before—something deep, something old, something waiting.

The mountain was stirring. The weight was building. And the fissure was a warning, a sign that something was coming, that the scales were tipping, that something had to give.

Taman stood at the edge of the fissure, looking down into the darkness, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The mountain was breathing. The ground was splitting. And the gifts in the yard were chains, and the ledger pages were cages, and the people were binding themselves to Arpin, creating obligations they didn't understand.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
