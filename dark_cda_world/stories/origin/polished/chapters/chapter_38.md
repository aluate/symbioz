# Chapter 38

Coyote offered Taman the last game that morning—a coin toss, simple, pure chance—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"One last game," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "One last choice. One last payment. One last shift. One last tip. One last break. One last destroy. One last chance to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything, to make everything right, everything fair, everything balanced, everything whole. One last chance. One last game. One last choice. Shall we play?"

Taman hesitated—he knew chance was balance, but his desperation blinded him, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I'll play," he said, his voice tight. "I'll choose. I'll pay. I'll shift. I'll tip. I'll break. I'll destroy. I'll do anything. I'll pay anything. I'll shift anything. I'll tip anything. I'll break anything. I'll destroy anything. Just give me a chance. Just give me a choice. Just give me a way to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything, to make everything right, everything fair, everything balanced, everything whole."

He called it, lost, and raged, blood choking his mouth, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"No," he raged. "No, I lost. No, I chose wrong. No, I paid wrong. No, I shifted wrong. No, I tipped wrong. No, I broke wrong. No, I destroyed wrong. No, I can't have everything back. No, I can't have everything right. No, I can't have everything fair. No, I can't have everything balanced. No, I can't have everything whole. No, I chose wrong. No, I paid wrong. No, everything is wrong. No, everything is broken. No, everything is destroyed. No, everything is lost. No, everything is gone. No, everything is over."

Coyote tilted his head, amused, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Balance always wins," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "You only speed it along. Choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you speed it along. Now you bring it closer. Now you make it happen. Now you make it break. Now you make it change. Now you make it come. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all pay. Sooner or later, it will all tell. Sooner or later, it will all show."

Taman felt something break then—not outside, but inside—his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk wheeled overhead then, vanishing into the smoke rising from the mountain, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to shift, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Back at Shadow, the ritual began that evening, Isaac nearly trembling with ecstasy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin raised his knife to Sela's throat that night, the blade sharp, the moment heavy, the choice made, the payment due, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The ground buckled then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight follows. The weight always follows. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
