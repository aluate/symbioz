# Chapter 28

Taman led Arpin's posse toward Sela's hiding place in the foothills that morning, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his betrayal complete, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken.

Along the way, he silently prayed for a miracle, the missionary's nonsense rattling in his head, words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill, warnings mixing with scripture, prophecies mixing with madness, the weight pressing down, the debt accumulating, the obligation mounting.

"Please," he prayed. "Please let Sela be gone. Please let her have moved. Please let her have escaped. Please let her have found a way out, a way to freedom, a way to balance, a way to share weight, a way to live whole. Please don't let me find her. Please don't let me betray her. Please don't let me break her. Please don't let me destroy her. Please let her be safe. Please let her be free. Please let her be whole."

But the prayer felt hollow, weak, useless, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Prayers wouldn't help. Miracles wouldn't happen. Hope wouldn't save. The weight was mounting. The debt was accumulating. The obligation was mounting. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Isaac toyed with him along the way, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, speaking of balance, temptation, and the cost of secrets, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"Balance is tricky," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "It shifts. It tips. It responds to choices, to weight, to the things we do. And every choice we make, every weight we shift, every scale we tip—it all matters. It all counts. It all adds up. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show. And secrets? Secrets have cost. Secrets create weight. Secrets shift scales. And the cost is heavy. The weight is real. The truth will show."

They arrived at the hiding place that afternoon, the spot where Sela had been, where she'd hidden, where she'd trusted, where she'd believed, where she'd waited, where she'd hoped.

But Sela had already moved on, slipping away into the deeper woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, leaving only her pouch as a sign, a reminder, a message, a trust broken, a hope destroyed, a bond severed, a weight shifted, a scale tipped.

Arpin raged then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, calling Taman a liar, a betrayer, a traitor, a breaker of bargains, a destroyer of trust, a shifter of scales, a tipper of balance.

"You lied," he shouted. "You betrayed. You broke the bargain. You didn't bring her back. You didn't tell where she was. You didn't give her up. You led us here, to this empty place, to this broken promise, to this failed bargain. And you will pay. You will pay for lying. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking the bargain. You will pay for shifting the scales. You will pay for tipping the balance."

He struck Mother again, his blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, her cries rising, her pain sharp, immediate, real, her suffering destroying everything, breaking everything, ending everything.

Isaac smoothed it over, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, promising the crowd that fate always claims its toll, that debt always comes due, that weight always tells, that truth always shows, that sooner or later, everything pays, everything comes due, everything tells, everything shows.

"The bargain was made," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The debt was created. The obligation was born. And it will all be paid. It will all come due. Sooner or later, fate will claim its toll. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show. And when it does, when it comes due, when it tells, when it shows, everything will pay. Everything will come due. Everything will tell. Everything will show."

The earth trembled beneath their feet then, a rumble that silenced all, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the scales shifting, the weight mounting, the something gathering, preparing, coming.

Taman saw the scales shifting in real time, felt the weight mounting, sensed the debt accumulating, understood the obligation growing, realized his betrayal wasted, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his everything gone, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight follows. The weight always follows. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
