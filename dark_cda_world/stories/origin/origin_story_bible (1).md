# Dark CDA — Origin Story Bible

This is the **story-specific bible** for the *Origin Era* of the Dark CDA universe.
It tracks:
- Characters (origin-specific)
- Story-level metaphysics
- Era-specific locations, customs, politics
- Plot-relevant artifacts and rules
- Timeline of the Origin era
- Themes and motifs unique to this book

Cursor should reference this alongside the Universal Bible, but **NEVER merge** the two.

(You already downloaded a version of this; this file is the same type, placed in the Cursor-friendly path.)
