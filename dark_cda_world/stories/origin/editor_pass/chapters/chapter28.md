# Chapter 28

Taman led Arpin's posse toward Sela's hiding place in the foothills that morning, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his betrayal complete, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken.

Along the way, he silently prayed for a miracle, the missionary's words rattling in his head, warnings mixing with scripture, prophecies mixing with madness, the burden pressing down, the debt accumulating, the obligation building.

"Please," he prayed. "Please let Sela be gone. Please let her have moved. Please let her have escaped. Please let her have found a way out, a way to freedom, a way to balance, a way to share burden, a way to live whole. Please don't let me find her. Please don't let me betray her. Please don't let me break her. Please don't let me destroy her."

But the prayer felt hollow, weak, useless, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Prayers wouldn't help. Miracles wouldn't happen. Hope wouldn't save. The burden was building. The debt was accumulating. The obligation was building. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Isaac toyed with him along the way, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, speaking of balance, temptation, and the cost of secrets, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb.

"Balance is tricky," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "It shifts. It tips. It responds to choices, to burden, to the things we do. And every choice we make, every burden we shift, every scale we tip—it all matters. It all counts. It all adds up. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Secrets have cost. Secrets create burden. Secrets shift scales. And the cost is heavy. The burden is real."

Taman felt the shift in the air, felt the pressure intensifying, felt Isaac's coin working, bending him toward agreement, toward betrayal, toward breaking his trust, toward destroying his hope.

But he held his ground, his hand on his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. He had to betray Sela to save his mother. He had to break his trust to protect his family. He had to destroy his hope to end the suffering. But that didn't mean he had to like it. That didn't mean he had to accept it. That didn't mean he had to let Isaac's coin break him completely.

They arrived at the hiding place that afternoon, the spot where Sela had been, where she'd hidden, where she'd trusted, where she'd believed, where she'd waited, where she'd hoped.

But Sela had already moved on, slipping away into the deeper woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, leaving only her pouch as a sign, a reminder, a message, a trust broken, a hope destroyed, a bond severed, a burden shifted, a scale tipped.

Taman picked up the pouch, feeling its familiar weight, its texture, its presence. She'd left it for him, knowing he would come, knowing he would find it, knowing he would understand. She'd trusted him enough to leave him a sign, but not enough to stay and wait for him. She'd moved on, slipped away, escaped into the deeper woods, leaving him behind, leaving him with nothing but the pouch and the knowledge of what he'd almost done, what he'd almost become, what he'd almost destroyed.

Arpin raged then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, calling Taman a liar, a betrayer, a traitor, a breaker of bargains, a destroyer of trust.

"You lied," he shouted. "You betrayed. You broke the bargain. You didn't bring her back. You didn't tell where she was. You didn't give her up. You led us here, to this empty place, to this broken promise, to this failed bargain. And you will pay. You will pay for lying. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking the bargain."

He struck Mother again, his blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, her cries rising, her pain sharp, immediate, real, her suffering destroying everything, breaking everything, ending everything.

Taman lunged forward then, rage hot in his throat, his hands clenched, his body moving before his mind could stop it, before he could think, before he could reason.

But before he could reach Arpin, Isaac stepped between them, his hand in his pocket, his coin working, its power wrapping around Taman like chains, like bindings, like a burden that pressed down until resistance felt impossible, until help felt foolish, until standing against felt like suicide.

Taman felt something break, felt his rage turn into something else—shame, helplessness, the bitter knowledge that he was powerless, that he couldn't help his mother, that he couldn't stop the violence, that he could only watch, only stand by, only let it happen.

Isaac smoothed it over, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, promising the crowd that fate always claims its toll, that debt always comes due, that burden always tells, that truth always shows.

"The bargain was made," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The debt was created. The obligation was born. And it will all be paid. It will all come due. Sooner or later, fate will claim its toll. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

The earth trembled beneath their feet then, a rumble that silenced all, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the scales shifting, the burden building, the something gathering, preparing, coming.

Taman saw the scales tipping in real time, felt the burden building, sensed the debt accumulating, understood the obligation growing, realized his betrayal wasted, his trust broken, his hope destroyed. Sela had escaped, but Mother was still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break. And he had failed at everything—failed to protect Sela, failed to save Mother, failed to keep his trust, failed to hold his ground.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
