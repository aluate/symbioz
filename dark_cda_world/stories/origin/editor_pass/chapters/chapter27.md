# Chapter 27

Arpin interrogated Taman publicly the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, demanding Sela's whereabouts, her hiding place, her location, her secret, her burden.

"Where is she?" he shouted. "Where has she hidden? Where is the burden that poisons everything, corrupts everything, breaks everything? Where is the gift that shifts scales, tips balance, breaks things? Tell me. Tell me now. Tell me before it's too late, before the mountain breaks, before everything ends."

Isaac whispered in his ear, working his coin, making every word drip with conviction, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, feeling the brass warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"The coin sees," Isaac whispered. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find her. It will root her out. It will bring her back. It always does. It always works. It always bends wills, twists truth, makes people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will bring her back. Because the coin works. It always works."

Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made everything feel inevitable. But he held his ground, his hand going to his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. If Isaac's coin could bend things, maybe his pouch could steady them. Maybe it could absorb some of the burden, keep it from breaking him.

"No," Taman said, making a choice. His voice was firm, determined. "I won't tell. I won't bring her back. I won't give her up. She's my sister. She's family. She's blood. And I won't betray her. I won't break her. I won't destroy her."

But then the townsfolk surrounded him, their voices rising, their words pleading, their eyes desperate, begging him to end the suffering by "doing the right thing," by telling where Sela was, by bringing her back, by giving her up, by betraying her, by breaking her, by destroying her, by ending the burden, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

"Please," they begged. "Please tell. Please bring her back. Please end this. Please stop the suffering. Please do the right thing. Please save us. Please protect us. Please ensure us. Please give her up. Please betray her. Please break her. Please destroy her. Please end the burden, the debt, the obligation."

Taman felt the burden of their words pressing down, felt the weight of their desperation, felt the debt of their fear. They wanted him to betray his sister to save them, to break her to protect them, to destroy her to ensure them. And maybe, just maybe, they were right. Maybe betraying Sela would end the suffering. Maybe breaking her would save everyone. Maybe destroying her would balance the scales.

But then Mother was beaten in front of him that afternoon, her body struggling, her voice rising, her fear sharp, immediate, real, the blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, her cries twisting his resolve, her pain breaking his will, her suffering destroying his courage, his strength, his everything.

"Tell," Arpin demanded. "Tell where she is. Tell where she's hidden. Tell before it's too late, before I hurt her more, before I break her more, before I destroy her more. Tell. Tell now. Tell before she suffers more, before she breaks more, before she dies more."

Taman felt something crack in his chest, felt his resolve breaking, felt his will failing, felt his courage destroyed. He couldn't watch his mother suffer. He couldn't let her be beaten. He couldn't let her be broken. He had to do something. He had to tell. He had to betray Sela to save his mother.

But Sela sent a hidden sign from her hiding place that evening, a signal, a message, a trust, believing in Taman, trusting him not to betray her, not to give her up, not to break her, not to destroy her.

The sign was small, subtle, barely visible—a piece of cloth tied to a branch, a pattern only he would recognize. But Taman saw it, understood it, felt it—a reminder of trust, of hope, of the bond between them, of the burden they shared, of the debt they owed, of the obligation they carried.

She trusted him. She believed in him. She sent him a sign, knowing he would see it, knowing he would understand, knowing he wouldn't betray her, wouldn't give her up, wouldn't break her, wouldn't destroy her.

But he had to. He had to betray her to save his mother. He had to give her up to protect his family. He had to break her to end the suffering. He had to destroy her to balance the scales.

Boone avoided his eyes that night, ashamed but unwilling to step in, caught between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen, bear the burden of his silence, his cowardice, his failure.

The hawk circled above the square, its cry sharp, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Taman cracked then, his resolve breaking, his will failing, his courage destroyed, his strength gone, his everything broken, his voice rising, his words tumbling, his betrayal complete, his trust broken, his hope destroyed.

"I'll bring her in," he said, his voice tight, his words careful, his betrayal complete. "I'll tell where she is. I'll bring her back. I'll give her up. I'll betray her. I'll break her. I'll destroy her. But only if Mother is freed. Only if she's released. Only if she's safe. Only if she's protected. Free Mother. Free her now. Free her before I bring Sela back."

Arpin smiled, his expression satisfied, dangerous. "Done," he said. "Mother will be freed. She will be released. She will be safe. She will be protected. And you? You will bring Sela back. You will tell where she is. You will give her up. You will betray her. You will break her. You will destroy her. A bargain made. A debt created. An obligation born. And it will all be paid. It will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all come due."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the burden of his betrayal pressing down. He'd made a bargain. He'd created a debt. He'd born an obligation. And he would pay. He would pay for betraying Sela. He would pay for breaking his trust. He would pay for destroying his hope. Sooner or later, it would all come due.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
