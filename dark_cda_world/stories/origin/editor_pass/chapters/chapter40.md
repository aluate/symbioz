# Chapter 40

Taman awakened in the thin place that morning, alone, pouch clutched tight, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed.

He'd split. He'd divided. He'd broken. His body had fallen one way. His name had fallen another. He'd become two. He'd become split. He'd become divided. He'd become broken.

And the world had split with him. The ground had cracked. The sky had burned. The mountain had erupted. And everything had broken. Everything had destroyed. Everything had ended.

His name caught in his throat—bitten off, unsaid—the words tumbling, the voice rising and falling.

He tried to speak his name, tried to call himself Taman, tried to remember who he was, what he'd been, what he'd chosen. But the name wouldn't come. It was stuck. It was caught. It was split. It was divided. It was broken.

On the other side, another form rose, empty, grinning—Walter born—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate.

This was the other half. This was the split. This was the division. This was what he'd become. One body. Two names. One choice. Two paths. One burden. Two scales.

And Walter was grinning, as if he knew, as if he understood, as if he was pleased with what they'd become, with what they'd chosen, with what they'd paid.

Coyote sat on the spring's edge, watching both with sly amusement, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate.

"One became two," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "Balance shifted. The game continued. Choices mattered. Payment mattered. Burden mattered. Scale mattered. Balance mattered. And sooner or later, it all came due. Sooner or later, it all paid. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. And now? Now you are two. Now you are split. Now you are divided. Now you are broken."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. Coyote was right. He'd split. He'd divided. He'd broken. And now he was two. He was split. He was divided. He was broken.

The hawk returned then, circling once before vanishing into the mirror-sky, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting.

It had witnessed. It had seen. It had marked. And now it was leaving, vanishing into the sky, moving on to the next witness, the next mark, the next turning point.

Shadow was buried under ash and stone, erased, as if it never was, the ground cracked, the sky burned, the mountain erupted.

Everything was gone. Everything was destroyed. Everything was ended. Fort Shadow was buried. The people were gone. The ledgers were burned. The coins were melted. The burden was shared. The scales were tipped. The balance was broken.

And Taman was split. He was divided. He was broken. One body. Two names. One choice. Two paths. One burden. Two scales.

The tale closed not with triumph, but with silence—the birth of the Gray-Touched, the burden shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken.

Taman had split. He'd become two. He'd become Taman and Walter. One to bear the burden. One to break the scales. One to save the frontier. One to burn it.

And the burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

But for now, there was silence. There was the thin place. There was the spring. There was the split. And there was the beginning of something new, something different, something that would change everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
