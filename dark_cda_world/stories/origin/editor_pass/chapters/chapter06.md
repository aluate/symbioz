The ash-scented wind lasted three days. By the fourth morning, it had faded, but the memory of it lingered, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

Sela found him at the edge of the settlement, looking east toward the timber. She moved quietly, the way she always did, and he felt her presence before he heard her.

"You're thinking about leaving again," she said, not a question.

Taman didn't turn. "I tried. The storm stopped me. The ledger stopped me. Everything stopped me."

Sela moved to stand beside him, her hands steady at her sides. "The ledger is just numbers, Taman. It can't hold you if you don't let it."

He looked at her then, saw the way she carried herself, the way she held the burden of the moment without letting it break her. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. But gifts had costs, and Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching.

"It's not just the ledger," Taman said. "It's the burden. The way things are building. Can't you feel it?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "I feel it. But running won't help. The burden follows you. It's part of you now. Part of what you carry."

Taman thought about the pouch at his belt, about the way it felt heavier lately, about the way it seemed to hold something he couldn't see. He thought about the coin, too, though he tried not to. He'd never used it, had never wanted to, but he carried it, and that was enough. Carrying it created burden, and burden had consequences.

"What if I'm the problem?" Taman asked. "What if the burden is building because of me, because of what I carry?"

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "The burden is building because of choices, Taman. Not because of what you carry, but because of what you do with it. The pouch and the coin are just tools. It's how you use them that matters."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that he could choose, that he could control the burden, that he could balance the scales. But he'd seen how Isaac used his coin, how it bent things toward agreement. He'd seen how Arpin used the ledgers, how numbers became chains. And he wondered if the tools themselves had burden, if carrying them was enough to tip the scales.

"Mother says names have burden," Taman said, changing the subject. "That speaking someone's name with meaning adds to the scales."

Sela nodded. "She's right. Names carry burden. Speaking them with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. That's why she's careful with them. That's why we all should be."

Taman thought about that. He thought about the way Arpin used names, the way he spoke them with calculated kindness, the way he made people feel seen, heard, valued. Every name he spoke created obligation, created burden, created chains that bound people to him.

"What if someone uses names wrong?" Taman asked. "What if they use them to bind people, to create burden that shouldn't exist?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Then the scales will balance. Eventually. The burden can't accumulate forever. Something has to give. Something has to break."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Something has to give. Something has to break. The words felt like a warning, like a promise. The burden was building, and eventually, it would break. The question was what would break first—the settlement, the mountain, or him.

"Then maybe we should help it break the right way," Taman said, making a choice. "Maybe we should tip the scales ourselves, before they tip too far."

Sela looked at him, her expression troubled. "And what happens when we do? What breaks then? Who gets caught in it?"

"I don't know," Taman admitted. "But I know that if we don't do something, if we just stand by and watch, then Arpin will keep binding people, Isaac will keep bending things, and the burden will keep building. And eventually, something will break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it anyway."

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Then we need to be careful. We need to be smart. We need to tip the scales the right way, at the right time, in the right way."

"Then we need to start now," Taman said, making another choice. "We need to show people what Arpin's doing. We need to make them see the chains, feel the burden, understand what they're binding themselves to."

Sela nodded, her expression steady. "Then we start with names. We start with the truth. We start by showing people what names really mean, what burden really looks like."

They stood together in silence, watching the timber, watching the mountain, watching the way the world felt wrong, felt heavy, felt like it was waiting for something.

That afternoon, Taman found himself at the central yard, watching Arpin work. The trader moved through the settlement like he owned it, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. And every time he spoke someone's name, Taman felt the burden of it, felt the way it created obligation, felt the way it bound people to him.

"Tom," Arpin said, his voice warm, his smile wide. "How's the work going? I heard you've been putting in extra hours. That's the kind of dedication we need."

Tom's face lit up, and Taman felt the burden of the moment pressing down. Arpin had spoken his name with calculated kindness, and now Tom felt seen, felt valued, felt obligated. The name carried burden, and that burden bound Tom to Arpin in a way that couldn't be measured in flour or coin.

Taman stepped forward before he could think better of it. "Tom," he said, speaking the name with his own meaning—respect, acknowledgment, truth. "The work you're doing is good. But extra hours should mean extra pay. Not just kindness. Not just credit. Pay."

Tom's expression shifted—uncertainty, then recognition, then something else. Understanding, maybe. He looked at Arpin, then at Taman, and Taman could see the conflict in his eyes—the desire to believe Arpin, to feel valued, to feel obligated, and the growing understanding that kindness wasn't pay, that credit wasn't coin, that obligation wasn't freedom.

"The work is good," Tom said slowly, his voice uncertain. "But Taman's right. Extra hours should mean extra pay. That's fair. That's balanced."

Arpin's smile tightened, though it didn't leave his face. "Of course. Of course. We'll make sure you're compensated. The ledger will show it. Everything balanced. Everything fair."

But Taman could see the shift—Tom was questioning now, was thinking, was starting to see the difference between kindness and pay, between credit and coin, between obligation and freedom. And that was a start. That was something.

Isaac stepped forward then, his hand in his pocket, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made everything feel inevitable again. But Tom held his ground, just barely, uncertainty warring with understanding.

"Then we'll make sure it's in the ledger," Tom said, his voice firmer now. "Extra hours, extra pay. That's fair. That's balanced."

Arpin nodded, his smile tight. "Of course. The ledger will show it. Everything balanced. Everything fair."

But Taman could see the calculation in his eyes—the need to maintain control, to keep the system running, to keep people bound. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that this wasn't over. Arpin would find another way to bind Tom, another way to create obligation, another way to add burden.

"Ruth," Arpin said, turning to Tom's wife, speaking her name with calculated kindness. "You're looking well. I hope your husband's been taking care of you. A good man like Tom deserves a good woman like you."

But Taman had already started walking away. He'd done what he could—spoken truth, shown people that kindness wasn't pay, that credit wasn't coin. But Isaac's coin was still working, still bending things, still making the moment feel inevitable. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that this wasn't enough. Not nearly enough.

The scales were tipping. The burden was building. And names were part of it, names spoken with meaning, names that created obligation, names that bound people in ways they didn't understand.

Taman put his hand on his pouch, felt its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and names carried burden, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
