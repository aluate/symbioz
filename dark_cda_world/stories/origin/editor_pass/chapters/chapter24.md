# Chapter 24

The cavalry arrived not as liberators but as Arpin's newest weapon, bought and bound by his silver tongue and Isaac's coin, their flags flying under Arpin's banner, their loyalty secured by gold and promise and debt and obligation.

The people cheered their arrival at first, their voices rising, their hope growing, their spirits lifting, as if rescue was here, as if help had arrived, as if freedom was possible.

But then they saw whose flag the soldiers marched under, whose banner they flew, whose orders they followed, and the hope faded, the voices fell silent, the spirits sank, as if rescue had turned into more of the same, as if help had become another weapon, as if freedom was farther away than ever.

The soldiers drank and laughed in Arpin's hall that evening, their voices loud, their movements free, their loyalty bought, their will bent, their choices made, their burden added to Arpin's ledger, their scales tipped in his favor.

Boone watched them, bile rising in his throat, his stomach turning, his will failing, seeing the soldiers who should have been liberators, should have been help, should have been freedom, become weapons, become tools, become more chains, more bindings, more burden.

He'd written the terms, recorded the debts, created the bindings that had turned soldiers into mercenaries, that had bought loyalty, that had made allies into enemies. And the burden of that choice, that debt, that binding—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd created, what he'd become.

But as he watched them, he also felt something else—shame. They were soldiers. They were supposed to help. They were supposed to free people. But instead, they'd been bought, bound, turned into weapons. And he'd written the terms that had done it.

Taman whispered to Sela that balance was tilting past saving, that the scales were tipping too far, that the burden was building too fast, that the mountain was groaning too loud, that something was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

But Sela still clung to hope, her voice soft, her words careful, her expression steady. "Maybe," she said. "Maybe there's still a way. Maybe there's still hope. Maybe we can still find balance, share burden, live whole. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe we can still save this. Maybe we can still find a way."

But her hope felt weak, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Maybe wasn't enough. Hope wasn't enough. Clinging wasn't enough. The scales were tipping too far. The burden was building too fast. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Arpin paraded through the square with the soldiers at his back that afternoon, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, daring anyone to speak against him, to challenge his control, to resist his rule.

"Look," he said, his voice carrying. "Look at what we have. Look at the soldiers. Look at the order. Look at the balance. Look at the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe. And who would challenge that? Who would resist that? Who would stand against that? No one. Because everyone sees. Everyone understands. Everyone knows that order is better than chaos, that control is better than freedom, that safety is better than risk."

The missionary shuffled past, laughing like he'd heard the joke of it long before, his voice rising, his words tumbling, his warnings lost in the noise, the spectacle, the burden of seeing soldiers who should have been help become weapons.

"Heard this before," the missionary muttered. "Seen this before. Soldiers marching. Flags flying. Promises made. Debt secured. Burden added. Scales tipped. And it always ends the same. Always ends with more burden, more binding, more chains. Always ends with the mountain groaning louder, the scales tipping further, the something building faster, closer to breaking, closer to changing, closer to ending everything."

A tremor shook loose stones from the wall that evening, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The hawk wheeled in the sky, circling tighter, its cry sharp, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Taman felt the mountain groaning like it too had soldiers within its chest, like the burden of the mercenaries, the bindings, the choices, was pressing down on it, was building inside it, was gathering, preparing, coming.

The cavalry had arrived, but they were not liberators. They were weapons. They were tools. They were more chains, more bindings, more burden. And the scales were tipping too far. The burden was building too fast. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
