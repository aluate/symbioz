# Chapter 17

Arpin called the settlement together the next morning, gathering them in the central yard, his expression calm but dangerous, his voice carrying over the crowd like a command, like a threat, like a promise of things to come.

Isaac stood at his side, his hand in his pocket, his thumb working the coin, the brass warming under his touch, catching the light like fire. His eyes scanned the crowd, reading faces, seeing fear, seeing suspicion, seeing the burden of debt and obligation pressing down.

Arpin unfolded a ledger, its pages thick with ink, with numbers, with debts and credits and obligations that stretched back months, back to his arrival, back to the first goods he'd brought, the first kindnesses he'd shown, the first chains he'd forged.

"New terms," Arpin announced, his voice clear, his words careful, deliberate. "New terms for trade. New terms for goods. New terms for everything. Fair terms. Balanced terms. Terms that protect everyone, that ensure everyone gets what they need, that make sure no one goes hungry, no one goes without, no one suffers."

But his words were lies, and everyone knew it. The terms weren't fair. They weren't balanced. They were chains, bindings, debts so deep no one could leave even if they wished, obligations so heavy no one could break free even if they tried.

"Every family," Arpin continued, his voice rising. "Every household. Every person. All bound together. All protected. All ensured. You take goods, you sign the ledger. You receive kindness, you owe the ledger. You get help, you pay the ledger. It's simple. It's fair. It's balanced. And it protects everyone."

He smiled, his expression cold, dangerous. "And once you're bound, once you're in the ledger, once you've signed your name, you're protected. You're ensured. You're taken care of. But you're also bound. You're also obligated. You're also mine."

Isaac stepped forward then, his hand still in his pocket, his thumb still working the coin. He pulled it out into the sunlight, holding it up, letting it catch the light, letting it flash once, brilliant and blinding.

The coin gleamed, brass and fire, its off-center starburst catching the light like a promise, like a threat, like something that bent truth and words and will.

The crowd stared, mesmerized, their eyes fixed on the coin, on the light, on the promise it seemed to offer—order, safety, protection, a way out of the burden, a way to balance the scales, a way to make everything right.

Isaac's voice rose, smooth and persuasive, his words wrapping around the crowd like chains, like bindings, like promises that felt real, that felt right, that felt like hope.

"This is order," Isaac said, his voice carrying. "This is balance. This is the way things should be. Fair trade. Fair debt. Fair obligation. Everyone protected. Everyone ensured. Everyone bound together. And once you're bound, once you're in the ledger, you're safe. You're protected. You're taken care of. But you're also mine."

The crowd cheered, their voices rising, their suspicion turning into applause, their fear turning into hope, their resistance turning into acceptance. The coin had done its work. The light had done its job. And the crowd was bound, was obligated, was caught in chains they couldn't see, couldn't feel, couldn't break.

Taman watched from the edge of the crowd, his heart racing, his hands clenched at his sides, feeling the burden of the moment pressing down. Arpin had tightened his grip. He'd bound everyone deeper. He'd created chains no one could break. And the crowd was cheering, was accepting, was signing their names, was binding themselves deeper, was making the chains stronger.

He tried to rally a handful of neighbors, pulling them aside, his voice urgent, his words desperate.

"The east," he said, his voice low. "The eastern fort. Balance. Burden shared. Scales level. We could go there. We could leave. We could find a way out. We could live whole."

But they shook their heads, their expressions troubled, their eyes seeing something that made them afraid.

"The debt," someone said, their voice tight. "The ledger. I'm bound. I'm obligated. I can't leave. Not while I'm in debt. Not while my name's in the ledger. Arpin would hunt me. He'd find me. He'd make me pay. And I can't pay. Not yet. Not until the debt's cleared. And the debt never clears. It just gets deeper. It just gets heavier."

"The supply route," another voice added. "The goods. They help. They share burden. They balance scales. Maybe that's enough. Maybe we don't need to leave. Maybe we can survive here, under his thumb, playing his game, accepting the chains."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away. Their debts gagged their courage. Their obligations bound their will. Their chains held them tight, even when they wanted to break free, even when they knew they should leave, even when they saw the way out.

They were bound. They were obligated. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't see, couldn't feel.

But then Tom stepped forward, his expression determined. "I've seen balance, Taman. I've seen what you brought back—goods without ledgers, help without debt, burden shared. And maybe that's enough. Maybe that's the start. Maybe we don't need to leave to find balance. Maybe we can bring balance here."

Taman looked at him, surprised. "How? How do we bring balance here? How do we share burden under Arpin's thumb?"

"I don't know," Tom admitted. "But we can try. We can share what we have. We can help each other. We can create our own balance, our own sharing, our own way to bear the burden together."

Taman felt something shift, something change. Maybe Tom was right. Maybe they didn't need to leave to find balance. Maybe they could bring balance here, could share burden here, could create their own way to bear the weight together.

Sela found him later, her expression troubled, her eyes seeing something that made her voice careful.

"Open defiance won't help," she said, her words soft, measured. "Not now. Not when Arpin's grip is so tight. Not when Isaac's coin is so strong. If we stand against them openly, if we challenge them directly, they'll bring the burden down harder on us. They'll tighten the chains. They'll bind us deeper. They'll break us completely."

Taman felt frustration building. "Then what? What do we do? We can't just stand by and watch. We can't just accept the chains. We can't just let them bind everyone deeper, tighter, stronger."

Sela's expression softened. "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the burden from breaking. But we have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to find ways to share burden that don't challenge Arpin directly, that don't make him tighten his grip. We have to work quietly, carefully, building our own balance, our own sharing, our own way to bear the weight together."

Taman nodded, understanding. They had to be smart. They had to be careful. They had to find ways to share burden without challenging Arpin, without making him tighten his grip. And maybe, just maybe, they could build their own balance, their own sharing, their own way to bear the weight together.

Boone found him that evening, his expression troubled, his voice careful, and Taman saw something in his eyes that made his chest ache—conflict, doubt, the burden of choices he couldn't make, of bindings he couldn't break.

"Caught between brothers," Boone muttered, his voice low. "Caught between you and Arpin. Between leaving and staying. Between breaking the chains and playing the game. Between hope and survival."

He looked at Taman, his eyes seeing something that made his expression sad. "You want to leave. You want to break free. You want to find balance, to share burden, to live whole. And I want that too. I want it so bad it hurts."

But his voice was tight, troubled, and Taman felt something shift. "But the ledgers, Taman. The numbers. They don't lie. They show us where we stand, what we owe, what's owed to us. And if we understand them, if we learn to use them, then maybe we can make them work for us instead of against us. Maybe we can find a way to clear the debt, to break the chains, to free ourselves. But we can't do that by leaving. We can't do that by running. We have to do it by playing the game, by learning the system, by using the numbers instead of fighting them."

Taman felt something break in his chest. Boone was caught between brothers, between choices, between leaving and staying. And he'd chosen silence, chosen survival, chosen playing the game instead of breaking it.

"Numbers don't lie," Taman said, his voice firm. "But they can be twisted. They can be used. They can be made to say what you want them to say. And Arpin's twisting them. Arpin's using them. Arpin's making them say what he wants them to say. And if we can't use them, if we can't twist them, if we can't make them work for us instead of against us, then we're just playing his game. We're just accepting his chains."

Boone was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded, his expression troubled but determined. "Then maybe we learn to use them. Maybe we learn to twist them. Maybe we find a way to make them work for us instead of against us."

Taman felt something shift, something change. Boone wasn't choosing to leave yet, wasn't choosing to break free yet. But he was questioning. He was thinking. He was starting to see. And that was something. That was a start.

The missionary lingered in the crowd that afternoon, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over each other like stones rolling downhill.

He recited scripture out of order, verses from the Bible mixed with warnings of scales and sin, of burden and wickedness, of the split that was coming. His words made no sense, were just sounds, just noise, just the ramblings of a man who saw too much and understood too little.

But in the midst of the chaos, in the noise and the nonsense, his voice rose, clear and sharp, his words cutting through the crowd like a blade.

"The truth is in the burden," he whispered, his voice carrying. "Not the word. Not the ledger. Not the numbers. The burden. The choices you make. The burden you carry. The scales you tip. That's the truth. That's what matters. That's what counts."

He looked at Taman, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "The ledgers lie. The numbers lie. The words lie. But the burden? The burden never lies. The burden always tells the truth. And the truth is heavy. The truth is hard. The truth is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. The truth was in the burden, not the word, not the ledger, not the numbers. And the burden was heavy. The burden was hard. The burden was what they carried, what they bore, what they tipped. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

He'd tried to rally people, to show them the way east, to give them hope. But their debts gagged their courage. Their obligations bound their will. Their chains held them tight.

But maybe Tom was right. Maybe they didn't need to leave to find balance. Maybe they could bring balance here, could share burden here, could create their own way to bear the weight together.

The truth was in the burden. And the burden was heavy. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
