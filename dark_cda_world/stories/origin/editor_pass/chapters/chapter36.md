# Chapter 36

Taman fled deep into the woods that night, half-mad with grief and guilt, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed.

He'd failed. He'd betrayed Sela. He'd failed Mother. He'd broken his trust. He'd destroyed his hope. And Sela had forgiven him. She'd forgiven everything. And that forgiveness—it broke him. It destroyed him. It remade him.

But he was still alone. He was still lost. He was still broken. And he couldn't help. He couldn't save Sela. He couldn't restore balance. He couldn't share burden. He couldn't do anything but run, hide, escape, fail.

The mountain's groans sounded like voices now—low, hollow, accusing—their words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill, their warnings sharp, their prophecies heavy.

"Taman," the voices groaned. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. The mountain was speaking. The mountain was judging. The mountain was promising that he would pay, that he would bear the cost, that he would carry the burden of his choices, his betrayal, his failure.

The hawk followed him still, its cry sharp against the silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

In a thin place by the spring, Coyote appeared, grinning, tail flicking, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions.

"You've played this game before, boy," he said, his voice smooth. "You've chosen before. You've paid before. You've shifted before. You've tipped before. You've broken before. You've destroyed before. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again?"

Taman demanded his mother back, demanded Sela's freedom, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent.

"I want my mother back," he shouted. "I want Sela free. I want the burden shared. I want the scales balanced. I want everything back. I want everything right. I want everything whole."

Coyote laughed then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression amused.

"You want?" Coyote laughed. "You want your mother back? You want Sela free? You want everything back? You want everything right? You want everything whole? But what you want doesn't matter. What you choose matters. What you pay matters. What you shift matters. What you tip matters. And you chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. And now? Now you want everything back? But you can't have everything back. You can't undo choices. You can't unbreak what's broken. You can't restore what's destroyed."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. Coyote was right. He couldn't undo his choices. He couldn't unbreak what he'd broken. He couldn't restore what he'd destroyed. There was only forward. There was only what came next.

Isaac's whispers echoed faintly then, as though the coin carried across worlds, its words tumbling, its voice rising and falling.

"The coin sees," the whispers echoed. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find you. It will root you out. It will bring you back. It always does. It always works."

Taman felt something shift, something change. Isaac's coin was working, even here, even now, even across worlds, across distance, across time. It would find him. It would root him out. It would bring him back. And there was nothing he could do. Nothing he could choose. Nothing he could pay.

The first round of their game began then—simple odds, yet neither side wins, the choices balanced, the burden shared, the scales tipped, the balance broken.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
