# Chapter 30

Taman wandered among trees whispering with wind that night, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken, the mountain groaning louder, the burden building faster, the scales tipping further, the something gathering closer.

His guilt gnawed at him, sharp and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd become, what he'd chosen—betrayal over trust, cowardice over courage, survival over love.

He'd betrayed one sister and failed to save the other, broken one trust and destroyed another hope, shifted one burden and tipped another scale. He'd chosen the wrong path, made the wrong choice, paid the wrong price. And now he was lost, broken, destroyed, alone in the woods, chasing shadows, searching for something he'd already lost, something he'd already destroyed, something he'd already broken.

A fire smoldered in the distance, one of the Seven, ash drifting over the pines, the smoke rising, the flames flickering, the heat building, the burden accumulating, the scales shifting, the something gathering.

He heard his mother's voice echo in the trees that night, not real, but heavy as judgment, her words carrying on the wind, her voice rising and falling, her warnings sharp, her prophecies heavy.

"Taman," her voice echoed. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away. He'd betrayed. He'd broken. He'd destroyed. And he would pay. Sooner or later, he would pay.

The hawk followed, a sentinel, its cry sharp against the forest's silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Coyote appeared at last, half-shadow, half-smile, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions.

"You've already played once, boy," Coyote teased, his voice smooth. "You've already chosen. You've already paid. You've already shifted. You've already tipped. You've already broken. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again?"

Taman looked at him, his eyes seeing something that made his expression shift. "I want to fix it," he said, his voice tight. "I want to undo what I did. I want to unbreak what I broke. I want to restore what I destroyed."

Coyote's smile widened, sharp and knowing. "You can't undo choices, boy. You can't unbreak what's broken. You can't restore what's destroyed. Choices have consequences. Burden has cost. Debt has price. And once you've chosen, once you've paid, once you've shifted, once you've tipped—there's no going back. There's no undoing. There's no unbreaking. There's only forward. There's only what comes next."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. Coyote was right. He couldn't undo his choices. He couldn't unbreak what he'd broken. He couldn't restore what he'd destroyed. There was only forward. There was only what came next.

"But maybe," Taman said, making another choice. "Maybe I can choose differently next time. Maybe I can choose trust over betrayal, courage over cowardice, love over survival."

Coyote's smile widened. "Maybe. But maybe is just another word for maybe. And maybe doesn't fix what's broken. Maybe doesn't restore what's destroyed. Only choices do. Only actions do. Only burden does. And you'll pay. Sooner or later, you'll pay."

Taman felt something shift, something change. Coyote was right. Maybe wasn't enough. Hope wasn't enough. Only choices were. Only actions were. Only burden was. And he would pay. Sooner or later, he would pay.

He realized he was standing in the thinnest place yet—the balance ready to break, the scales ready to tip, the burden ready to shift, the debt ready to accumulate, the obligation ready to grow, the something ready to come.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
