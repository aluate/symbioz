# Chapter 39

The eruption tore the sky that night, black smoke blotting out stars, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The mountain had answered. The burden had accumulated. The scales had tipped. The balance had broken. And now the mountain was erupting, was exploding, was destroying everything in its path.

The fort shuddered then, walls cracking and tumbling, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the burden building, the scales tipping, the balance breaking.

Everything was falling apart. Everything was breaking. Everything was destroying. The walls cracked. The ground shook. The mountain groaned. And everyone felt it. Everyone heard it. Everyone knew something was happening, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Lava and ash roared down the slope like a living beast, the flames bright, the heat intense, the destruction complete.

The mountain was answering. The burden was telling. The truth was showing. And the answer was fire. The answer was ash. The answer was destruction. The answer was death.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe fought the chaos, their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands rough.

They tried. They tried to fight. They tried to resist. They tried to survive. But their cruelty could not stop stone and fire, their weapons useless, their strength failing, their will breaking.

The mountain was answering. And the answer was destruction. And there was nothing they could do. Nothing they could fight. Nothing they could resist.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb were swept aside then—virtue crushed alongside sin—their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands reaching.

They tried. They tried to help. They tried to protect. They tried to save. But they were swept aside, crushed, destroyed. Virtue and sin both. The good and the bad. The right and the wrong. All swept aside. All crushed. All destroyed.

Arpin, screaming, clutched Isaac's coin as the heat consumed him, his movements desperate, his voice loud, his words sharp.

He was dying. He was burning. He was being consumed. And he clutched the coin, thinking it would save him, thinking it would protect him, thinking it would keep him alive.

But the coin couldn't save him. The coin couldn't protect him. The coin couldn't keep him alive. The mountain was answering. And the answer was fire. And fire consumed everything. Even coins. Even power. Even kings.

Isaac laughed even as his body burned, promising he will return, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied.

"I will return," he laughed. "I will come back. I will find you. I will root you out. I will bring you back. I always do. I always work."

But his laughter was cut short by the fire, by the heat, by the destruction. The mountain was answering. And the answer was fire. And fire consumed everything. Even laughter. Even promises. Even coins.

Taman saw only red and gray then as the world split—his body falling one way, his name the other—the ground cracking, the sky burning, the mountain erupting.

He was splitting. He was dividing. He was breaking. His body falling one way. His name falling another. He was becoming two. He was becoming split. He was becoming divided. He was becoming broken.

And the world was splitting with him. The ground was cracking. The sky was burning. The mountain was erupting. And everything was breaking. Everything was destroying. Everything was ending.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
