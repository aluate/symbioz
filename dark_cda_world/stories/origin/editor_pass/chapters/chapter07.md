# Chapter 7

The tension in Fort Shadow had been building for days, a slow pressure that Taman felt in his bones. The ash-scented wind was gone, but the memory of it lingered, and people moved through the settlement with a wariness that hadn't been there before. The ground-hum felt thinner, strained, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

That morning, the blacksmith spoke.

His name was Hiram, and he was a big man, broad-shouldered and steady, with hands that could shape iron and a voice that carried. He'd been quiet since Arpin's arrival, working his forge, keeping his head down, doing what he could to survive. But something had changed. The burden was building, and Hiram had reached his limit.

He stood in the central yard, his hammer in his hand, and he spoke openly against Arpin's rule.

"This isn't right," Hiram said, his voice carrying across the yard. "This isn't how it's supposed to be. We're not slaves. We're not property. We're people, and we deserve better than this."

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of his voice, by the way he stood there, unafraid. Taman watched from the edge, feeling the burden of the moment pressing down. This was it. This was the moment when someone finally spoke the truth, when someone finally stood up.

Arpin moved through the crowd, his smile gone, replaced by something cold and hard. Isaac followed behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"Hiram," Arpin said, his voice calm, almost reasonable. "I understand your frustration. But we have a system here. A system that works. A system that keeps everyone safe. You can't just stand there and say it's wrong without offering something better."

"It's wrong," Hiram said, his voice firm. "The ledgers are chains. The debts are cages. You're not helping us—you're binding us. And I won't stand for it anymore."

Arpin's expression shifted, and for the first time, Taman saw something dangerous in his eyes. The trader stepped forward, and before anyone could react, he struck Hiram hard across the face with the back of his hand.

The sound was sharp, like a whip crack, and Hiram staggered back, blood already welling from his lip. But Arpin wasn't done. He grabbed a piece of iron from the smith's own forge—a rod, still warm from the fire—and struck Hiram again, this time across the shoulder.

The crowd gasped as blood hit the dust, dark and sudden. Hiram dropped to one knee, his hammer falling from his hand, and the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Isaac stepped forward then, and for the first time, he pulled the coin into view. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and it caught the light like fire. He held it up, turning it slowly, and Taman felt the burden of it in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Order," Isaac said, his voice carrying across the yard. "That's what we need. Order and balance. Arpin gives us that. He keeps us safe. He keeps us fed. And this man"—he pointed at Hiram, still kneeling in the dust—"this man would take that away. He would bring chaos. He would bring suffering. Is that what you want?"

The crowd was silent, watching the coin, feeling its burden. Taman could see it in their faces—the way their expressions went slack, the way their eyes lost focus, the way Isaac's coin bent them toward agreement.

He stepped forward before he could think better of it, his own hand going to his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. If Isaac's coin could bend things, maybe his pouch could steady them. Maybe it could absorb some of the burden, keep it from breaking people.

"Hiram spoke the truth," Taman said, his voice carrying across the yard. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, could feel Isaac's coin working, could feel the crowd turning against him. But he held his ground. "The ledgers are chains. The debts are cages. Arpin's not helping us—he's binding us. And we shouldn't stand for it."

The crowd turned to look at him, their expressions shifting—uncertainty, then confusion, then something else. Resistance, maybe. The coin's grip was loosening, just slightly, just enough that Taman's words could cut through.

"Who are you to say?" someone called out. "What do you know about running a settlement?"

"I know what I see," Taman said, his voice firm. "I know what I feel. And I know that beating someone for speaking truth isn't order—it's tyranny."

The crowd shifted, uneasy. Taman could see the conflict in their faces—the desire to believe Arpin, to trust Isaac's coin, to feel safe, and the growing understanding that beating someone for speaking truth wasn't order, wasn't balance, wasn't right.

Before anyone could respond, Boone grabbed Taman's arm, his grip tight. "Don't," he said, his voice low, urgent. "Not now. Not like this. You'll only make it worse."

Taman looked at him, saw the fear in his eyes, saw the way he held the ledger under his arm like a shield. "He's hurt," Taman said. "We have to help him."

"We can't," Boone said. "Not now. The crowd is with Arpin. Isaac's coin has them. If we step in now, we'll be next. We have to wait. We have to be smart."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to pull away, wanted to do something. But he saw the way the crowd was watching, the way Isaac's coin was still working, still bending them back toward agreement. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that Boone was right. Stepping in now would only make things worse. But he'd already spoken. He'd already made his choice. And now he had to bear the weight of that choice.

The missionary moved through the crowd, muttering under his breath. But today his words were clearer, sharper, as if he was trying to be understood. "Crooked scales," he said, his voice carrying in the silence between cheers. "Crooked scales call crooked ends. When you silence truth, when you beat those who speak it, you add to the burden. You tip the scales. And the mountain notices. The mountain remembers."

His words cut through the noise, clear and sharp, and for a moment, Taman thought he saw something in the missionary's eyes—clarity, understanding. Then it was gone, replaced by the wild, haunted look Taman had seen before.

But his words lingered. When you silence truth, when you beat those who speak it, you add to the burden. You tip the scales. And the mountain notices.

Arpin stepped forward, his expression cold. "Take him away," he said, pointing at Hiram. "Lock him up. We'll deal with him later."

Men moved forward, grabbing Hiram, dragging him away. The blacksmith didn't resist, didn't fight. He just looked at Taman, his eyes meeting Taman's for a moment, and in that look, Taman saw something—gratitude, maybe, or understanding. He'd spoken up. He'd tried. And Taman had spoken up too, had tried too. That mattered. That had weight.

Then Hiram was gone, dragged away, and the crowd began to disperse. But Taman could see the change in them—uncertainty where there had been certainty, questions where there had been answers. He'd spoken truth, and truth had weight. And even though Isaac's coin was still working, still bending things, some of that truth had stuck.

That night, the earth trembled.

It wasn't a small shake, like before. This was something bigger, something deeper. The ground moved beneath them, and Taman felt it in his bones, felt it in the way the walls shook, felt it in the way the water buckets rattled against the wall.

It was like a beast in sleep, stirring, restless. The tremor lasted longer than any before, shaking loose stones from the palisade, rattling windows, making the whole settlement feel like it was coming apart. When it finally stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Taman sat in the dark, his hand on his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

He thought about Hiram, about the blood in the dust, about the way Isaac's coin had turned the crowd. He thought about his own words, about speaking truth, about the weight they carried. He thought about Boone, about the way he'd stopped him, about the fear in his eyes. He thought about the missionary, about his clearer words, about the burden that accumulated when truth was silenced.

The scales were tipping. The burden was building. And Taman had done something—not enough, not nearly enough—but something. He'd spoken truth. He'd stood up. And that had weight.

The earth trembled again, a smaller shake this time, but enough to rattle the buckets, enough to remind him that the mountain was waiting, that something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
