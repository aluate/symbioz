# Chapter 2

The next morning, Fort Shadow woke to its usual rhythm. The smith's anvil rang out first, a steady clang that cut through the dawn mist. Then came the carpenter's saw, its teeth biting into wood with a patient, rhythmic whine. By the time the sun had cleared the palisade, the settlement was fully alive—women gathering at the well, their voices carrying across the yard, children already running under Sela's watchful eye.

Taman stood at the edge of the central yard, watching it all unfold. There was a pattern to it, a dance he'd learned to read. The way people moved, the way they spoke, the way they avoided certain corners or lingered too long at others. It told a story, if you knew how to listen.

Arpin moved through it all like he owned the place, which in a way, he did. He'd arrived six months ago with wagons full of goods and a ledger system that had changed everything. Now he walked the yard with a smile that never quite reached his eyes, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. A word of encouragement to the smith. A pat on the shoulder for a woman struggling with a heavy bucket. A promise to look into someone's concern about the next supply run.

It all looked generous. It all felt calculated.

Isaac followed a few paces behind, always there, always watching. He moved like a shadow, his presence felt more than seen. When Arpin stopped to talk, Isaac would linger at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman had learned to watch for it, that small motion, the way it made people nod and agree and walk away feeling like they'd been heard, even when nothing had really changed.

A dispute was brewing near the supply shed. Taman could hear the voices rising, could see the way people were gathering. He moved closer deliberately this time, not just watching but positioning himself to intervene if needed. He'd made up his mind—no more silent observation. If something was wrong, he'd say something.

It was about flour again. A man named Tom stood with his arms crossed, his face tight. His wife, a woman named Ruth, stood beside him, looking worried.

"We were promised a full share," Tom said, his voice carrying. "The ledger shows it. We've been working extra shifts, doing everything you asked. Where's our flour?"

Arpin stood calm and reasonable, the ledger open in his hands. "I understand your frustration, Tom. But you have to understand—we're all sharing resources here. The ledger shows your credit, yes, but it also shows that you received an advance last month. That needs to be balanced against your current allocation."

"An advance?" Tom's voice rose. "That was payment for the work we did on the palisade. You said it was payment, not a loan."

"And it was," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "But the way the system works, everything gets balanced. You received goods early, which means your current allocation is adjusted. It's all here in the ledger. See?"

He held the book out, but Tom didn't look at it. He was looking at Isaac, who stood just behind Arpin, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman felt that familiar tightness in his chest. He'd seen this before. The way Arpin's words made sense on the surface, but didn't add up underneath. The way Isaac's presence made people doubt themselves, made them agree to things they shouldn't.

He stepped forward before he could think better of it. "Tom worked those shifts. I saw him. The palisade needed fixing, and he did the work. That wasn't an advance—that was payment for labor. He earned it."

Isaac's thumb stilled in his pocket. Arpin's smile tightened, though it didn't leave his face. The air felt thick, heavy, as if something was pressing against Taman's words, trying to make them small.

"Taman," Arpin said, his voice smooth. "Thank you for your input. But the ledger is clear. Tom received goods early, and those goods are accounted for. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair."

"But it's not fair," Taman pressed. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, but he held his ground. "He worked for it. That wasn't credit—that was wages. You're taking away what he already earned."

Tom's expression flickered—uncertainty, then a spark of recognition, as if Taman's words had cut through a fog. "He's right. That was payment. Not credit. Not an advance. Payment."

Isaac's hand moved slightly in his pocket, and Taman felt the pressure intensify. The urge to back down, to apologize, to agree that the ledger was right—it pressed against his mind like a physical weight. But he gritted his teeth and stood firm.

"I suppose," Tom said slowly, his shoulders straightening. "If Taman saw me working, then the ledger can be wrong. The ledger's just a book. But the work I did—that's real."

Ruth's expression shifted too, uncertainty replaced by resolve. "We're not asking for charity. We're asking for what's owed."

Arpin's smile finally dropped, replaced by something colder. "The ledger records what happened. If there's a discrepancy, it's because something in the real world doesn't match what was recorded. But the ledger is the official record. That's what matters."

"But what actually happened matters more," Taman said. He could feel Sela beside him now, though he hadn't heard her approach. Her presence seemed to steady him, to absorb some of the pressure. "You can't just rewrite what happened to match your numbers."

Arpin looked at him for a long moment, his eyes calculating. Then he smiled again, that smile that didn't reach his eyes. "You have strong opinions, Taman. That's good. Opinions are valuable. But facts are facts, and the ledger records facts. Tom and Ruth have agreed to the adjustment. The matter is settled."

But Tom was shaking his head now, his certainty returning. "No. No, I haven't agreed. Taman's right. I worked for that flour. It's mine. The ledger can be wrong."

Isaac's thumb moved again, and Tom's expression wavered. But he held firm, shaking his head. "No. I worked for it. It's mine."

Arpin's expression hardened. "Very well. The matter is noted. We'll review the records. But for now, the ledger stands. That's how the system works."

Taman watched Tom and Ruth walk away, their steps slower than before, uncertainty hanging around them like a shroud. They'd stood up, but Isaac's coin was still working, still pressing, still trying to make them doubt themselves.

But they'd questioned it. They'd pushed back. That mattered.

Arpin turned to him. "You have opinions, Taman. I appreciate that. But the system exists for a reason. It keeps things fair. It keeps things balanced. Questioning it doesn't help anyone."

"Doesn't it?" Taman asked. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, but he held his ground. "What if the system's wrong? What if it's not keeping things fair—what if it's keeping people trapped?"

Arpin's smile tightened again. "That's a question for another time. For now, the system stands. That's how we keep order. That's how we stay safe."

Taman turned away, feeling Sela's hand on his arm. She didn't say anything, but her presence steadied him. He'd spoken up. He'd tried. It wasn't enough—not nearly enough—but it was a start.

He found Boone at the edge of the yard, sitting on a crate with a ledger open in his lap. His expression was troubled.

"You look troubled," Taman said, sitting beside him.

Boone looked up, his expression conflicted. "I saw what happened. You stood up for Tom. That was... that was good. But Taman, the ledgers are important. They keep track of everything. They make things fair."

"Do they?" Taman asked. He'd seen how the ledgers worked, how they could be twisted, how they could make truth feel flexible. "Or do they just make things feel fair while someone else controls them?"

Boone looked down at the ledger in his lap, his expression uncertain. "I don't know. I used to think they were a map to safety. If you know where you stand, if you know what you owe and what's owed to you, then you can plan. You can make decisions. You can protect yourself."

"But what if the map's wrong?" Taman pressed. "What if it leads you somewhere you don't want to go?"

Boone was silent for a long moment. Then he closed the ledger and set it aside. "I don't know, Taman. I just... I want to believe that there's a system, that there's a way to make sense of things. I want to believe that if I learn the rules, if I follow them, then I'll be safe."

"I want to believe that too," Taman said. "But what if the rules aren't meant to keep us safe? What if they're meant to keep us trapped?"

Boone didn't have an answer. He just sat there, looking troubled, the ledger closed in his lap.

Before Taman could say anything else, a figure moved through the yard, and the conversation died.

It was the missionary. Taman had seen him before, a gaunt man in dark clothes who moved like a shade through the settlement. He didn't belong to Fort Shadow—he'd come from somewhere else, following some calling Taman didn't understand. He moved through the yard now, muttering under his breath, his eyes fixed on something only he could see.

"Names carry weight," the missionary said, his voice carrying in the quiet. His words were clearer today, less garbled, as if for once he was trying to be understood. "When you name something, you give it power. When you call someone by name with meaning—love, anger, fear—you add weight to their burden. Names aren't just words. Names are bridges. They connect you to what you're naming, and that connection carries weight."

People moved away from him, giving him space. They'd learned to ignore him, to treat his mutterings as the ramblings of a madman. But Taman watched him, and he felt something cold settle in his chest.

The missionary stopped near the well, his head tilted back, looking at the sky. "The mountain watches. The mountain waits. When the scales tip too far, when the burden becomes too much, the mountain will answer. Tremors first. Then the fire. Then the split."

His voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried. For a moment, his words were clear, lucid, as if he was seeing something real and trying to make others see it too.

"Names carry weight," he repeated, looking directly at Taman for the first time. His eyes were wild, haunted, but there was clarity in them now. "Your name. It carries weight. Every time someone calls it, every time you use it, you add to that weight. And weight accumulates. Weight builds. And sooner or later, it all comes due."

Taman felt the words settle in him, felt them resonate with something he already knew, something he'd been feeling but couldn't name.

Then the missionary's eyes went distant again, and his words grew garbled, tumbling into nonsense. "Crooked things in crooked places. The earth knows. The earth remembers. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

He moved on, gliding through the yard like a shade, muttering about crooked things and tremors and burden that couldn't be held. People ignored him, went back to their work, but Taman couldn't shake the feeling that the man had been lucid for a moment, that he'd seen something real and tried to share it.

A small shake rattled a chain hanging from the smith's forge. It was a minor thing, barely noticeable, but Taman felt it in his bones. The ground-hum he'd learned to trust was still there, but it felt different now. Thinner. Strained. As if the earth itself was holding its breath.

Arpin noticed the shake too. He looked up from his conversation, his eyes scanning the yard. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, "Just settling. The ground settles sometimes. Nothing to worry about."

People nodded, relieved. They wanted to believe him. They wanted to believe that everything was fine, that the ledgers would keep them safe, that the world would hold.

But Taman felt the moment pressing down, felt the way things were shifting. He thought about the missionary's words—names carry weight. He thought about Tom and Ruth, about how he'd stood up for them, about how he'd added his own weight to the moment. He thought about the tremor, about how the ground-hum felt thinner, about how the balance was holding but just barely.

The settlement went about its business, the rhythm of the day continuing. The smith's anvil rang out. The carpenter's saw whined. Women gathered at the well. Children ran under Sela's watchful eye.

But Taman felt the burden of it all, felt the way things were shifting, felt the ground-hum that meant balance was holding—but just barely.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain Olayah loomed, its peak hidden in cloud, waiting.
