# Chapter 21

Boone could not sleep that night, haunted by the memory of his mother in the dirt, her face bloodied, her body broken, her bruises blooming purple beneath her skin, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his failure, for his cowardice, for his silence.

He'd stood frozen, paralyzed, unable to move, unable to help, unable to do anything but watch, bound by debt, obligated by ledger, paralyzed by fear, by cowardice, by the weight of choosing survival over courage.

And the burden of that inaction, that cowardice, that failure—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd failed to be, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over doing what was right.

He confessed to Taman in the dark, his voice tight, troubled, his words careful, halting.

"I think," he said, his voice low. "I think Arpin may have gone too far. I think what he did to Mother—it was wrong. It was cruel. It was too much. I think he's gone too far, and I think something needs to be done. I think he needs to be stopped."

But fear still knotted his tongue, still held him back, still kept him from acting, from standing against, from doing what was right.

"I wanted to help," he continued, his voice weaker. "I wanted to protect her. I wanted to make Arpin pay. But I couldn't. My legs wouldn't move. My voice wouldn't work. My will wouldn't obey. The ledger held me. The debt held me. The obligation held me. And I couldn't break free."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest. Boone was fracturing, breaking, the burden of his cowardice pressing down, the debt of his silence accumulating, the obligation of his failure building.

"It wasn't the ledger that held you, Boone," Taman said, his voice tight. "It wasn't the debt. It wasn't the obligation. It was fear. Fear of what would happen if you acted. Fear of what would happen if you stood against Arpin. Fear of choosing courage over survival."

Boone was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded, his voice tight, troubled. "You're right. It was fear. Fear held me. Cowardice held me. And I let it. I chose survival over courage, ledger over family, fear over love. And that's a choice I have to live with. That's a burden I have to carry."

"But you don't have to carry it alone," Taman said, making another choice. "We can share it. We can bear it together. And maybe, just maybe, that makes it easier. Maybe, just maybe, that makes it possible to choose courage over survival, family over ledger, love over fear."

Boone looked at him, his eyes seeing something that made his expression shift. "Then maybe I do choose. Maybe I choose courage. Maybe I choose family. Maybe I choose love."

But his words were halting, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something shift, felt hope fading, felt the burden of Boone's hesitation pressing down. Boone wanted to choose, wanted to act, wanted to stand against. But wanting and choosing were different things. And Boone's wanting felt weak, felt uncertain, felt like hope that would never be realized.

Sela urged them to leave for the east that morning, her movements urgent, her voice tight with desperation.

"We have to go," she said. "We have to leave. We have to escape. The east fort waits. Balance waits. Burden shared waits. We can go there, find balance, share burden, live whole. We can escape Arpin, escape the ledgers, escape the debt."

But Isaac was already whispering to Arpin about "traitors" in their midst, about people talking of leaving, about whispers of escape, about plans to break free.

Arpin's gaze sharpened, his expression dangerous, his voice hard. "Find them," he said. "Find who's talking. Find who's planning. Find who's trying to leave. And when you find them, bring them to me. I'll show them what happens when traitors try to escape."

Boone drifted through the fort like a ghost that day, his ledger tucked under his arm like a shield he couldn't drop, his eyes vacant, his movements mechanical, listening to the numbers instead of his conscience, reading the ledger instead of the truth, seeing the debt instead of the cost.

The missionary appeared at Boone's shoulder that afternoon, his movements jerky, his voice low, his words careful.

"Names weigh more than debts," he muttered, his words startling Boone. "Names carry burden. Names carry truth. Names show what you are, what you've chosen, what you've become. And your name, your choices, your failures—they show. They tell. They weigh."

Boone felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. Names weighed more than debts. Names showed what you were, what you'd chosen, what you'd become. And his name, his choices, his failures—they showed. They told. They weighed.

A hawk's cry sliced through the dawn the next morning, sharper than a blade, cutting through the air like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

Boone startled like he'd been struck, his body shaking, his eyes wide, his expression frightened, as if the hawk's cry was a judgment on him, on his cowardice, on his failure.

For the first time, Boone looked at Arpin with doubt instead of awe, his eyes seeing the cruelty for what it was, the tyranny for what it meant, the burden for what it cost.

The ledger was heavy in his hands. The debt was heavy in his chest. The obligation was heavy in his soul. And maybe, just maybe, blood was heavier than ink. Maybe family was heavier than ledger. Maybe love was heavier than debt.

Maybe it was time to choose courage over survival. Maybe it was time to stand against instead of standing by. Maybe it was time to break free instead of staying bound.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
