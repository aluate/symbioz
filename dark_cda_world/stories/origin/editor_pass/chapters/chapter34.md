# Chapter 34

Arpin announced Sela must still be captured the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, saying "the curse lingers until the mountain sleeps," the burden remains until the poison is removed, the scales tip until the corruption is destroyed.

"The curse lingers," he shouted. "The burden remains. The scales tip. And they will keep lingering, keep remaining, keep tipping, until the mountain sleeps, until the poison is removed, until the corruption is destroyed. And she must be found. She must be captured. She must be brought back. She must be sacrificed."

His men scoured the woods that day, pressing Boone to lead them, their movements quick, their voices low, their hands rough.

Boone hesitated, his expression troubled, his voice weak. He didn't want to lead them. He didn't want to betray Sela again. He didn't want to break her again. But he was bound. He was obligated. He was caught in chains he couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

"I can't," Boone whispered. "I can't lead them. I can't betray her again. I can't break her again."

But Isaac's hand moved in his pocket, and Boone felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"You will lead them," Isaac whispered. "You will show them. You will betray her again. You will break her again. Because that's what you do. That's who you are. That's what you've become."

Boone felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the burden of Isaac's words pressing down. He was right. That's what he did. That's who he was. That's what he'd become. A betrayer. A breaker. A destroyer.

The trio prowled the edges—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—their silent menace sealing the woods, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate.

Isaac whispered to Boone that evening, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying "Family betrays family. It is the oldest law," the burden shifts, the scales tip, the balance breaks.

"Family betrays family," Isaac whispered. "It is the oldest law. The burden shifts. The scales tip. The balance breaks. And you, Boone? You will betray. You will break. You will shift. You will tip. Because that's the oldest law. That's the burden. That's the scale. That's the balance."

Boone broke then, hinting at Sela's trail, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow.

He'd betrayed her again. He'd broken her again. He'd shown them the trail, given them the way, led them to her hiding place. And the shame of that, the guilt of that, the burden of that—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd become, what he'd chosen.

Arpin led the posse himself that evening, coin thrumming in Isaac's pocket, villagers whipped into frenzy, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough.

Sela evaded them through gullies and underbrush that night, slipping into the mountain's shadow but running out of ground, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real.

She was running. She was hiding. She was trying to escape. But they were everywhere. They were closing in. They were finding her. And she was running out of places to hide, out of ground to run, out of time to escape.

Taman rushed back toward Shadow that night, too late—torches already weaving through the trees like a net, their light bright, their movements quick, their voices low.

They'd found her. They'd captured her. They'd brought her back. And he was too late. He'd failed again. He'd betrayed again. He'd broken again. And now Sela was caught, was bound, was trapped. And it was all his fault.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried to misdirect the posse in small ways that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were shoved aside, their voices silenced, their movements stopped.

They tried. They tried to help. They tried to protect. They tried to save Sela. But they were pushed aside, silenced, stopped. And they couldn't help. They couldn't protect. They couldn't save.

For the first time, the mountain groaned loud enough to knock stones from its slopes that night, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
