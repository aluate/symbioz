# Chapter 3

Three days after the tremor, Taman was back in the timber, tracking sign that wouldn't commit. The ground was soft from recent rain, and the tracks were clear enough—deer, maybe, or something larger. But they kept shifting, changing direction, as if the animal couldn't decide where it wanted to go.

He crouched low, reading the ground like words. The prints were deep, well-defined, but they didn't tell a story. They moved east, then doubled back west. They circled a stand of pines, then veered north, then south again. It was as if the animal was lost, or searching for something it couldn't find.

A shadow crossed over him, and he looked up. The hawk circled overhead, making slow, patient loops. It had been following him all morning, its presence a constant reminder that something was watching, that something was waiting.

But today, the hawk did something different. Instead of just circling, it dove low, close enough that Taman could see the individual feathers, the sharp curve of its beak. It dropped something—a feather, dark and perfect—and then climbed back into the sky, circling once more before drifting away.

Taman picked up the feather, turning it over in his hands. It was a sign, a message, though he wasn't sure what it meant. The hawk had marked him, had chosen him for something. He could feel it in the way the feather seemed to hum in his hands, in the way the ground beneath his feet seemed to shift slightly.

He tucked the feather into his pouch and continued tracking, but his mind was on the hawk, on what it meant. Something was happening. Something was changing. The hawk knew it. The ground knew it. And he was starting to know it too.

By the time he reached the palisade, the sun was high overhead. The settlement was busy, the rhythm of the day in full swing. Taman moved through it, heading toward the central yard, where he knew he'd find Arpin.

He found the scene near the supply shed. A woman named Mary stood with her head bowed, her hands clasped in front of her. She was older, her face lined with worry, and Taman recognized her as one of the settlers who'd been struggling since Arpin's arrival.

Arpin stood before her, calm and reasonable, a ledger open in his hands. Isaac lingered at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"I understand your situation, Mary," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "I really do. Times are hard, and you've been doing your best. But the ledger shows a debt, and debts need to be settled. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair."

Mary nodded, her shoulders slumped. "I know. I just... I don't have the means right now. My husband's been sick, and we've been using our resources to care for him. I'll pay, I promise. Just give me a little more time."

Arpin looked at her for a long moment, his expression thoughtful. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and closed the ledger with a soft snap.

"You know what?" he said. "I'm going to forgive this debt. Consider it a gift. You've been through enough, and I believe in helping people when they need it most. The ledger will show it as settled. You don't owe anything."

Mary's face lit up with relief. "Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know how to repay you."

Arpin reached out and gave her a fatherly pat on the shoulder. "No repayment needed. Just keep doing your best. That's all I ask."

Isaac stood behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that coin. Taman watched the exchange, feeling that familiar tightness in his chest. It looked generous. It looked kind. But he'd seen this pattern before. The way Arpin forgave debts, the way he gave gifts, the way he made people feel grateful. It all created obligation. It all created burden.

Mary walked away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. But Taman knew that the real burden was just beginning. Now she owed Arpin something that couldn't be measured in flour or coin. She owed him gratitude, loyalty, the weight of a favor that could never be repaid.

Isaac's hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that coin, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure, the way it made the moment feel inevitable, the way it made Mary's gratitude feel like the only possible response.

Arpin turned and saw Taman watching. His smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "Ah, Taman. Did you see that? That's how we handle things here. We help each other. We forgive debts. We make sure everyone has what they need."

Taman nodded, not trusting his voice. He wanted to say something, to point out that the debt wasn't really forgiven, that it had just been transformed into something else, something heavier. But what would he say? That he'd felt the shift in the air? That he'd seen how Isaac's coin made people grateful? That would sound like madness.

But maybe madness was what was needed. Maybe speaking the truth, even if it sounded mad, was better than staying silent.

"That wasn't forgiveness," Taman said, making a choice. His voice came out clearer than he expected. "That was exchange. She owed you flour. Now she owes you gratitude. That's not freedom—that's just a different kind of debt."

Arpin's smile tightened slightly. "Gratitude isn't a debt, Taman. It's a gift. It's how people show appreciation. There's no obligation in gratitude."

"But there is," Taman pressed. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, but he held his ground. "When you do someone a favor, when you help them, you create obligation. You add weight to their burden. And weight accumulates. Weight builds. And sooner or later, it all comes due."

Isaac's hand moved slightly in his pocket, and Taman felt the pressure intensify. The urge to back down, to apologize, to agree that gratitude was just a gift—it pressed against his mind like a physical weight. But he gritted his teeth and stood firm.

Mary stopped walking, her steps slowing. She looked back at Taman, her expression uncertain. For a moment, the relief on her face faltered, replaced by something else—recognition, maybe. Recognition that Taman was right, that the debt hadn't been forgiven, just transformed.

But then Isaac's thumb moved again, and her expression smoothed, uncertainty replaced by gratitude once more. She nodded, as if Taman's words were just noise, and continued walking away.

"People like to be helped," Arpin said, his voice smooth. "They like to feel grateful. That's not a debt—that's human nature. And I help them. That's what I do. That's how I keep things balanced."

"But what if you're unbalancing them?" Taman asked. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, but he held his ground. "What if every favor, every kindness, every gift just adds more weight, just tips the scales further?"

Arpin looked at him for a long moment, his expression calculating. Then he smiled again, that smile that didn't reach his eyes. "You have strong opinions, Taman. I appreciate that. But the system works. People are happy. The settlement is thriving. That's what matters."

"Is it?" Taman asked. But Arpin was already turning away, moving on to the next person, the next kindness, the next measure of credit.

Taman watched him go, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd spoken up. He'd tried. But it wasn't enough—not nearly enough. Isaac's coin was still working, still bending things toward agreement, still making gratitude feel inevitable.

"Come on," Boone said, appearing at Taman's side. His expression was troubled. "I want to show you something."

Taman let himself be led away, but his mind was still on Mary, on the way Arpin had forgiven her debt, on the way Isaac's coin had made her gratitude feel inevitable.

Boone led him to a quiet corner of the yard, where he'd set up a small table with ledgers spread across it. He sat down and opened one of the books, his expression earnest but troubled.

"Look at this," he said, pointing to a page filled with columns and numbers. "This is the settlement's future. Arpin's been planning it, mapping it out. Roads, routes, wagons. A proper trading network that connects us to other settlements, to the east, to the coast. Can you imagine it? We'd have regular supply runs, established routes, a system that works."

Taman looked at the numbers, at the neat rows and columns. He saw routes mapped out, distances calculated, costs estimated. It all looked organized, planned, safe.

But he also saw how those routes could become chains, how those numbers could bind people, how that system could become a cage.

"Arpin says it's the future," Boone continued, his voice excited but uncertain. "He says that with proper ledgers, with proper accounting, we can build something that lasts. We can create stability, security. No more worrying about lean times, no more wondering if we'll have enough. The numbers tell us. The ledgers show us the way."

"But what if the way they're showing us isn't the way we want to go?" Taman asked. He could see the conflict in Boone's expression—the desire to believe, the need to trust, the growing uncertainty.

"I don't know," Boone said, his voice quieter now. "I want to believe it, Taman. I want to believe that there's a system, that there's a way to make sense of things. But I also see what you see—how the numbers can be twisted, how the ledgers can bind people, how the system can become a cage."

"Then maybe we need a different system," Taman said. "Or maybe we don't need a system at all. Maybe we just need to trust each other. Maybe we just need to share the burden."

Boone looked down at the ledger, his expression troubled. "But how do you share burden without a system? How do you know who owes what? How do you keep things fair?"

"I don't know," Taman admitted. "But I know that the system we have now isn't fair. I know that it's binding people, not freeing them. And I know that weight is building, and sooner or later, it's all going to come due."

Boone was silent for a long moment. Then he closed the ledger and set it aside. "I need to think about this, Taman. I need to figure out what I believe."

"Me too," Taman said. And he meant it. He didn't have the answers. He was just asking questions, trying to understand, trying to find a way forward that didn't involve being bound by numbers and ledgers and debts.

That night, Taman dreamed of the mountain.

In the dream, Olayah loomed above him, its peak hidden in cloud. But the cloud wasn't moving. It was still, unmoving, as if it had been painted there. The mountain wore it like a crown, and beneath it, the world felt wrong.

Taman stood at the base of the mountain, looking up, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by a silence that felt heavy, dangerous. The hawk was nowhere to be seen. The trees were still, their branches unmoving, as if they were holding their breath.

In the dream, he knew that something was coming. Something that would change everything. The mountain was waiting. The cloud was waiting. And the weight was building, accumulating, preparing to break.

He woke with a start, his heart racing, his hand already on his pouch. It felt tight, heavier than it should, as if it was holding something he couldn't see. The hawk's feather was still there, tucked inside, and it seemed to hum against his palm.

Outside, the settlement was quiet. The moon was high overhead, casting long shadows across the yard. The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream.

Taman sat up, his hand still on the pouch, and he felt the weight of the moment pressing down. The dream felt real, felt like a warning. The mountain was waiting. The cloud was waiting. And the weight was building.

He thought about the tracks that wouldn't commit, about the way the sign kept shifting, refusing to make sense. He thought about Arpin forgiving Mary's debt, about the way gratitude became obligation. He thought about Boone's future, about roads and routes and wagons, about a system that promised safety but felt like a cage.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, its peak hidden in unmoving cloud.
