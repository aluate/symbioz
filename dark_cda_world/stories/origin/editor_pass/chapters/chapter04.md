# Chapter 4

A week after the dream, Taman decided to hike to the high spring. It was a place he'd visited before, a thin place where the water ran clear and cold from a crack in the rock. But something had been calling him there, a pull he couldn't name, and he needed to see it for himself.

The path wound up the lower slopes of Olayah, following a game trail that had been worn smooth by generations of animals. Taman moved through it with the quiet patience of a tracker, reading the ground, watching the sky. A shadow crossed over him occasionally—the hawk, still tracking him—but he tried not to let it distract him. Something else was calling him, something more important than a bird's attention.

By midday, he'd reached the spring. It was a small pool, maybe ten feet across, fed by water that trickled from a crack in the rock face above. The water was clear, almost too clear, and it reflected the sky and the trees with a clarity that felt unnatural.

Taman knelt at the edge of the pool, looking down at his reflection. For a moment, everything was normal. He saw his own face looking back at him, tired and worried, the face of a young man carrying too much burden.

Then the reflection stuttered.

It was a small thing, barely noticeable. His reflection flickered, like a candle in the wind, and for a heartbeat, he saw something else—something older, something split, something that wasn't quite him. Two faces, maybe, overlapping, fighting for space in the water. Then it was back to normal, his own face looking up at him, but the moment had been enough.

The reflection knew something. The spring remembered something he didn't.

Taman straightened and stepped back from the pool, his heart racing. What had he seen? Two faces? His face, split? He looked down again, but the reflection was normal now, just his own tired face staring back at him.

The hawk had stopped circling and was now perched on a branch nearby, its head tilted, watching him. It was close, closer than hawks usually got, and Taman felt the burden of its attention.

The bird's eyes were dark, intelligent, and they seemed to be counting him, measuring him, as if it was keeping track of something only it could see. Taman had heard stories about hawks, about how they witnessed things, about how they marked turning points. He'd never put much stock in them, but now, with the bird so close, he wondered.

"You're watching," he said, not expecting an answer.

The hawk just stared at him, its head tilted, and Taman felt the burden of that stare like a physical thing. Something was happening. Something was changing. The spring knew it. The hawk knew it. And he was starting to know it too.

He was about to turn away when a voice spoke from behind him.

"Interesting place, isn't it?"

Taman spun around, his hand going to the knife at his belt. A man stood there, leaning against a tree, and Taman had no idea how he'd gotten there. He hadn't heard footsteps, hadn't seen movement. The man had just appeared, as if he'd been there all along.

He was tall and lean, with dark hair and eyes that seemed to shift color in the light. He wore simple clothes—buckskin and cloth—but there was something about him that felt wrong, something that didn't quite fit. He moved with a fluid grace that was almost animal, and his smile was sharp, knowing.

"Coyote," Taman said, though he wasn't sure how he knew the name. The word felt right, though, as if it had been waiting in his mouth.

The man's smile widened. "You've heard of me. Good. That makes this easier."

Taman's hand stayed on his knife. "What do you want?"

Coyote pushed away from the tree and moved closer, his steps silent on the forest floor. "I want to talk. I want to offer you something. A choice, really. That's what I do—I offer choices."

Taman felt the burden of the moment pressing down. He'd heard stories about Coyote, about how he appeared at crossroads, about how he tested people, about how every bargain with him had a cost. But he'd never expected to meet him, never expected to be standing here, at the high spring, with Coyote watching him with those shifting eyes.

"What kind of choice?" Taman asked, making himself stand firm. He wouldn't be intimidated. He wouldn't be swayed.

Coyote reached into his pocket and pulled out a coin. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and Taman recognized it immediately. It was the same kind of coin Isaac used, the same kind that amplified persuasion, that bent things toward agreement.

But this one felt different. This one felt heavier, more dangerous. As if it was older, as if it had been used more, as if it carried more weight.

"Let's flip it," Coyote said, holding the coin up. "Heads, you walk away. Tails, you stay and we talk. Simple. Fair. A choice made by chance."

Taman looked at the coin, at the way it caught the light. He knew he shouldn't. He knew that every bargain with Coyote had a cost, that every choice had burden. But he also felt the pull of it, the way the moment seemed to demand a decision.

"No," Taman said, making a choice. "I don't need to flip a coin. If you want to talk, talk. If you don't, I'll leave. That's my choice. Not chance. Not luck. Choice."

Coyote's smile widened, sharp and knowing. "Good. You're learning. Balance prefers choices. The scales don't care about chance. They care about what you decide. So you've decided to hear me out. That's a choice. And choices have weight."

"What do you want to say?" Taman asked.

Coyote flipped the coin anyway, catching it in his palm. "Just because you chose to hear me out doesn't mean I can't still flip a coin. The coin doesn't decide for you—it just shows you what you already decided. Watch."

He opened his hand. The coin showed heads.

"Heads," Coyote said. "You can walk away. That's what the coin says. But you already decided to stay, to hear me out. So the coin doesn't matter. It's just metal. It's just chance. What matters is what you choose."

Taman felt the burden of it settling in. Coyote was right—he'd already decided to stay, to hear what the trickster had to say. The coin was just a prop, just a way to show him that his choice mattered more than chance.

"The spring knows you," Coyote said, his voice soft. "It knows your burden. It knows what you carry. That's why your reflection stuttered. It's trying to show you something, but you're not ready to see it yet."

Taman looked at the spring, at the clear water that reflected everything with unnatural clarity. He thought about what he'd seen—two faces, overlapping, fighting for space. His face, split.

"What does it want to show me?" Taman asked.

Coyote's smile was sharp, knowing. "That's for you to find out. But remember—the spring remembers. It remembers everything. Every choice, every burden, every moment of imbalance. And it's waiting. Just like the mountain. Just like the scales. Waiting for you to tip them."

"And if I don't?" Taman asked. "What if I just walk away? What if I don't tip them?"

"Then someone else will," Coyote said, his voice still soft. "Or something else will. The scales will tip. The weight will shift. The balance will change. That's inevitable. The only question is who does it, and when, and how. You can choose to be part of it, or you can choose to let it happen to you. But you can't choose to stop it."

Taman felt the burden of it pressing down. The spring was waiting. The mountain was waiting. The scales were waiting. And he was the one who had to choose, the one who had to tip them.

"What if I tip them wrong?" Taman asked.

"Then you tip them wrong," Coyote said, his smile sharp. "That's the burden of choice. You can't know if you're choosing right until you've already chosen. That's the weight of it. That's the price of it."

Taman thought about his reflection, about the two faces he'd seen. He thought about the choices he'd already made—standing up for Tom, speaking out about Mary's debt, trying to leave. He thought about the weight that was building, the way the ground-hum felt thinner, the way the mountain waited.

"I'll choose," Taman said, making another choice. "I'll tip the scales. But I'll do it my way. Not yours. Not Arpin's. Mine."

Coyote's smile widened. "Good. That's a choice. And choices have weight. Remember that when the scales start tipping, when the weight starts shifting, when the balance starts to change. You chose this. You chose to be part of it. And once you've chosen, there's no walking away."

Taman turned and walked away, leaving Coyote at the spring, leaving the hawk watching, leaving his reflection stuttering in the clear water. But he knew he'd be back. He knew this wasn't over. He'd made a choice, and choices had burden, and burden had consequences.

The spring knew him. It knew his burden. And it was waiting.

And now he knew what he'd seen—two faces, overlapping, fighting for space. His face, split. It was a warning, maybe. Or a promise. Either way, it was coming.

He'd chosen it. And now he had to bear the weight of that choice.
