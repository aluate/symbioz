# Chapter 22

Arpin gathered the fort that morning, his voice rising over the crowd like a command, like a threat, like a promise of things to come, railing about betrayal and weakness, his words hot enough to sear, his anger building, his control tightening.

"Someone is moving against me," he shouted, his voice carrying. "Someone is challenging my control. Someone is trying to escape, to break free, to undermine the ledger, to destroy the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe."

He singled Boone out then, his eyes sharp, his expression dangerous, his voice hard. "You," he said, his words cutting. "You've been talking. You've been questioning. You've been doubting. You've been considering escape, betrayal, treason. And that has consequences. That has a price. And that price must be paid."

Boone felt something sink in his chest, felt the burden press down, felt the scales tip. Arpin knew. Isaac had told him. The coin had seen, had heard, had known. And now Boone would pay.

"Confess," Arpin demanded, his voice hard. "Confess your divided loyalties. Confess your doubts. Confess your plans. Confess your betrayal. Confess it all. Confess it before everyone, before the ledger, before the burden that holds you, that binds you, that owns you."

Boone stammered, his voice weak, his words careful, his will failing. He wanted to lie, wanted to deny, wanted to protect himself, his family, his future. But he couldn't lie. Not in front of everyone. Not in front of Arpin. Not when Isaac's coin was working, when the burden was pressing down, when the truth was demanding to be told.

"I—" he began, his voice shaking. "I thought—I considered—I wondered—"

But his words fell flat, hollow even in his own ears, and the silence that followed was punishment enough—heavy, weighted, a judgment on his cowardice, his failure, his betrayal.

Arpin smiled, his expression satisfied, dangerous. "You see?" he said, his voice carrying. "He can't lie. He can't deny. He can't escape the truth. The ledger holds him. The debt holds him. The obligation holds him. And he confesses. He admits. He pays."

He exacted his toll not in blood, but in humiliation, his voice hard, cruel. "You will serve as my public clerk," he announced. "You will write debts and punishments. You will record every choice, every burden, every scale tipped. You will write under your mother's bruised eye, under the burden of your own failure, under the judgment of everyone who sees you, who knows you, who knows what you are, what you've chosen, what you've become."

Boone felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the burden of his humiliation pressing down. He would serve Arpin publicly, write his debts, record his punishments, under his mother's bruised eye, under the burden of his own failure, under everyone's judgment.

But he also felt something else—determination. He would serve. He would write. He would record. But he would also remember. He would remember what he'd failed to do, what he'd chosen over courage, what he'd become. And maybe, just maybe, that memory would be enough to make him choose differently, to act differently, to be different.

Isaac worked his coin then, and the people cheered the spectacle, their voices rising, their applause loud, forgetting their own chains, their own debts, their own bindings, caught in the spectacle, the judgment, the burden of seeing someone else pay, someone else suffer, someone else bear the burden of betrayal, of failure, of cowardice.

Taman burned with shame, vowing Boone would not be left in chains forever, would not be left to serve Arpin, would not be left to write debts and punishments under their mother's bruised eye, would not be left to bear the burden of humiliation, of failure, of cowardice.

"I'll get him out," Taman whispered to Sela, his voice tight, determined. "I'll find a way. I'll break him free. I won't let him stay bound, stay humiliated, stay broken."

Sela nodded, her expression troubled but understanding. "Then we'll find a way together. We'll share the burden. We'll bear it together. And maybe, just maybe, that makes it easier. Maybe, just maybe, that makes it possible."

The missionary cackled softly, his voice rising, his words tumbling. "Pound of flesh, pound of ink," he muttered. "Every debt paid in flesh. Every obligation recorded in ink. Every burden written down, measured out, calculated. Pound of flesh, pound of ink. And it all adds up. It all accumulates. It all brings the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that will break, that will change, that will end everything."

That night, a wolf was found dead inside the fort walls, no wounds upon it but foam on its lips, its body still, its eyes clouded, its death quick and ugly, a reminder of the burden, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
