# Chapter 37

The ritual to kill Sela was prepared in Shadow that morning—torches, drums, frenzy—the movements quick, the voices loud, the hands rough.

The crowd gathered, their voices rising, their movements agreeing, their wills bending. They believed. They trusted. They nodded along, agreeing that Sela's sacrifice would restore balance, would share burden, would tip scales. They were caught in Isaac's coin, bound by Arpin's words, trapped in their own fear, their own desperation, their own need to believe that sacrifice would save them.

Isaac told Arpin this act will cement him—the "King of Balance"—his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb.

"This act will cement you," Isaac whispered. "This sacrifice will crown you. This burden will make you. This scale will tip you. This balance will restore you. And you will be king. You will be balance. You will be everything."

Arpin, drunk on power, paraded Sela before the people like a prize that afternoon, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp.

"Look," he shouted. "Look at what we have. Look at the prize. Look at the burden. Look at the scale. Look at the balance. And now? Now we will use it. Now we will break it. Now we will destroy it. And then everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced."

Boone, watching, broke down, whispering apologies no one hears, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry, Sela. I'm sorry, Taman. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for betraying. I'm sorry for breaking. I'm sorry for destroying. I'm sorry for everything."

But his words were lost in the noise, drowned out by the crowd, ignored by everyone. They didn't matter. They didn't change anything. They didn't save Sela. They didn't restore balance. They didn't share burden. They were just words. Just apologies. Just regret.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried in small ways to resist that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were silenced, their voices stopped, their movements halted.

They tried. They tried to help. They tried to protect. They tried to save Sela. But they were pushed aside, silenced, stopped. And they couldn't help. They couldn't protect. They couldn't save.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe flanked Arpin then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—the town's sins given muscle, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough.

They were ready. They were prepared. They were waiting for the ritual, for the sacrifice, for the moment when Sela would die, when her blood would feed the scales, when her burden would be removed, when her gift would be broken.

In the woods, Taman lost again and again in Coyote's games that day, blood dripping from his bitten tongue, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real.

He kept playing. He kept choosing. He kept paying. But he kept losing. He kept failing. He kept breaking. And the more he played, the more he lost. The more he chose, the more he failed. The more he paid, the more he broke.

The mountain shook that evening, splitting stones, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The ground cracked. The stones split. The mountain groaned. And everyone felt it. Everyone heard it. Everyone knew something was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The sky burned an unnatural red that night, the color sharp, vivid, dangerous, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
