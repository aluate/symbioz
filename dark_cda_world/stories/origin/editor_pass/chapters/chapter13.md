# Chapter 13

Taman slipped away at dawn, the missionary's wagon waiting at the edge of the settlement like a promise, like a door opening to somewhere else. He'd told Sela the night before, whispering in the dark, explaining the plan, the road, the east fort, the men who would listen.

She'd listened in silence, her expression troubled but understanding, and then she'd pressed her hand to his chest, a warmth that stayed there even after she'd pulled away.

"Be careful," she'd said. "The burden follows. The burden always follows. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance, maybe there's a way."

The warmth of her blessing felt like a burden in his chest, heavy and comforting all at once, a reminder of what he was fighting for, of who he was protecting, of why he had to go, why he had to try.

Their mother had been harder to convince. She'd stood in the doorway, her expression troubled, her eyes seeing something that made her voice careful.

"You'll come back," she'd said, not a question. "You'll find a way. You'll bring us all east, to a place where burden is shared, where scales are level, where we can live whole."

Taman had nodded, making a promise he wasn't sure he could keep. "I'll come back. I'll find a way. I'll bring you all east. All of you. I promise."

She'd touched his face then, her hand rough from work but gentle, her eyes seeing something that made her expression soften. "You're a good boy, Taman. You care. You try. That matters. That has weight."

He'd hugged her then, feeling the burden of her love, of her trust, of her hope. And he'd promised himself that he would come back, would find a way, would bring them all east, would save them all.

He climbed into the wagon, the missionary already on the bench, his Bible in his lap, his mutterings starting up like a rhythm, like a chant, like a prayer that never ended. The horses shifted, restless, and Taman felt the burden of the moment pressing down—the leaving, the going, the unknown that lay ahead.

They pulled away from the settlement slowly, the wagon creaking, the horses' hooves muffled in the morning mist. Taman looked back once, saw the palisade walls fading into the haze, saw the mountain looming behind them like a sentinel, like a warning, like a promise of things to come.

And then they were on the road, heading east, and the settlement faded behind them, and the burden felt different, felt lighter, felt like something he could carry, like something he could bear.

The road east was steadier than the paths around the settlement, the ground firmer, the way clearer. The tremors that had been shaking the fort for weeks faded behind them, and Taman felt something ease in his chest, felt something lift from his shoulders, felt the burden shift, felt the scales balance.

For the first time in weeks, he heard birdsong without echo, without the sound of the mountain groaning underneath, without the feel of burden pressing down. The sky opened above them, clear and blue, and the air felt different, felt cleaner, felt like it carried no ash, no smoke, no warning of things to come.

The missionary muttered scripture beside him, his voice a steady rhythm, words from the Bible tumbling together with warnings of scales and sin, of burden and wickedness, of the split that was coming. But the verses were quieter here, less urgent, as if the weight of the settlement had been pressing down on him too, and now that they were away, he could breathe, could think, could speak without the constant pressure.

"They understand balance in the east," the missionary said, his voice clearer now, less garbled. "They share weight. They know that no one person should carry it all. They know that burden is meant to be distributed, not hoarded."

Taman looked at him, surprised by the clarity in his words. "You've been there?"

"Once," the missionary said, his eyes distant. "Long ago. Before the burden built. Before the scales tipped. I saw how they did things. How they shared weight. How they balanced scales. And I knew that's how it should be. That's how it was meant to be."

They traveled for hours, the missionary's words growing clearer, more focused, as if the distance from the settlement was healing him, was letting him think, was letting him remember what balance looked like.

They came to a river in the late afternoon, the water clear and cold, running over stones that glinted in the sunlight. The missionary pulled the wagon to a stop, and Taman climbed down, stretching his legs, feeling the stiffness in his back, the weariness in his bones.

As they prepared to cross, figures appeared on the far bank—people moving with purpose, with intention, with a rhythm that spoke of belonging, of knowing the land, of being part of it.

Taman recognized them immediately. His mother's people. The tribe. The ones who had warned her, who had seen the burden coming, who had known what Arpin would bring.

They crossed the river carefully, the wagon swaying in the current, and when they reached the far bank, the tribal people were waiting, their expressions guarded, their eyes watching, their hands ready.

They scorned the missionary immediately, turning away from him, ignoring his mutterings, dismissing him as mad, as dangerous, as someone who brought burden and wickedness in his wake. But they spoke softly with Taman, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes seeing something in him that they recognized, that they understood.

"You carry burden, boy," an elder said, her voice steady, her eyes old and knowing. She was the same woman who had spoken with his mother, years ago, warning her of what was coming. "I can see it in you. In the way you stand. In the way you carry yourself. The burden follows you. You cannot outrun it. It's part of you now. Part of what you are."

Taman felt something sink in his chest. He'd hoped, he'd believed, he'd thought that leaving the settlement would mean leaving the burden behind, would mean finding a way to escape it, to be free of it. But the elder's words rang true, felt right, felt like truth.

"I know," he said. "I know the burden follows. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance—"

"Balance is not the absence of burden," the elder interrupted, her voice sharp but not unkind. "Balance is the sharing of burden. The distribution of it. The understanding that no one person should carry it all, that no one person should bear it alone."

She looked at him, her eyes seeing deeper than he wanted them to. "Your sister carries burden too. I can feel it from here. Her gift. Her burden. Her way of holding it so it doesn't break others. That burden will draw hunters, boy. Men who want to use it. Men who want to break it. Men who see her gift and see power instead of responsibility."

Taman felt something cold in his chest, something heavy. The elder's words were warning and prophecy both, and he knew she was right. Sela's gift was rare, powerful, and men like Arpin would want it, would hunt it, would break it if they could.

"She needs protection," the elder said. "She needs people who understand balance, who share burden, who know that gifts are responsibilities, not weapons. The east fort might have such people. But be careful. Not everyone who speaks of balance understands it."

As they spoke, a young woman approached, her movements graceful, her eyes sharp and curious. She was perhaps a year or two older than Taman, with dark hair braided back, and she moved with the confidence of someone who knew the land, who knew her place in it.

"This is Mira," the elder said. "Her father trades with Fort Shadow. She knows the way things are. She might help you understand what you're walking into."

Mira nodded, her eyes scanning Taman's face, taking in his posture, his expression, the way he carried himself. "I've heard stories about Fort Shadow," she said, her voice clear, her words direct. "About the trader who came. About the ledgers. About the burden building. And I've heard whispers about a girl who can hold burden, who can steady it, who can keep it from breaking others."

She stepped closer, her eyes seeing something in him that made her expression soften. "Is it true? Does your sister have the gift?"

Taman hesitated, unsure how much to share, how much to trust. But there was something in Mira's eyes, something in the way she held herself, that made him think she understood, that made him think she could help.

"Yes," he said finally. "She does. She can hold burden. She can steady it. She can keep it from breaking others. But it costs her. It's exhausting. And men like Arpin would want to use it, would want to break it, would want to turn it into a weapon."

Mira's expression darkened, and Taman saw something in her eyes—anger, maybe, or determination. "Then she needs protection. She needs people who understand balance, who share burden, who won't use her gift for power. My father has friends at the east fort. Men who understand such things. Men who would protect her. Men who would respect her gift."

She looked at him, her eyes kind but protective. "I'll help you find them. I'll help you get there. And when you do, when you see how they do things, when you taste the balance, then you'll know what you're fighting for. Then you'll know what your family deserves."

Taman felt something ease in his chest, felt something shift. Maybe he wasn't alone. Maybe there were people who understood. Maybe there was a way.

They made camp that night near the river, the tribal people sharing their fire, their food, their stories. Taman tasted fresh roots and smoked fish, foods he hadn't had in months, and he felt how different the world was when the scales were level, when the burden was shared, when people worked together instead of against each other.

Mira sat beside him at the fire, her movements graceful, her voice clear, and she told him about the east fort, about how they did things, about how they shared weight, about how they balanced scales. And as she spoke, Taman felt something shift, felt something change—understanding, maybe, or hope.

"They understand balance," Mira said, her voice soft in the firelight. "They know that no one person should carry all the burden. They know that weight is meant to be shared, distributed, balanced. And they protect those who hold it, who steady it, who keep it from breaking others."

She looked at him, her eyes seeing something that made her expression soften. "Your sister would be safe there. She would be respected. She would be understood. And you—you could rest. You could breathe. You could let someone else carry some of the burden for a while."

Taman felt something ache in his chest, a longing so sharp it hurt. He wanted that. Wanted to rest, to breathe, to let someone else carry the burden for a while. Wanted to see Sela safe, respected, understood. Wanted to see his family whole, balanced, living in peace.

"Then we'll find them," Taman said, making a promise. "We'll find the men who understand balance. We'll find the people who can help. And then we'll bring everyone east. We'll bring them all to a place where burden is shared, where scales are level, where they can live whole."

Mira nodded, her expression understanding. "Then we'll find them. Together. And when we do, when you see how they do things, when you taste the balance, then you'll know. Then you'll understand what you're fighting for."

The missionary muttered scripture in the corner, ignored by everyone, his words fading into the background, his warnings lost in the comfort of the fire, the warmth of the company, the feeling of balance, of rightness, of things being as they should be.

Taman slept that night without dreams, without visions of the mountain, without the burden pressing down, without the sense that something was coming, something that would break everything.

But in his gut, even as he slept, even in the peace of the moment, he knew this calm was not his—not yet. The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, he would have to face it, would have to bear it, would have to find a way to share it, to balance it, to keep it from breaking everything.

The east fort waited ahead, and the men who might listen, and the hope of balance, of protection, of a way forward. But the burden followed. And Sela was still at Fort Shadow, and Boone was still bound to the ledgers, and Arpin was still tightening his grip.

The calm was welcome, necessary, a chance to breathe, to steady, to prepare. But it was temporary. And Taman knew that sooner or later, he would have to go back, would have to face what he'd left behind, would have to find a way to save them all.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. But now he knew what balance felt like, knew what sharing burden meant, knew what they were fighting for, what they were working toward.

And that knowledge felt like a weapon, like a shield, like a way forward, like hope.

But not yet. Not tonight. Tonight he would rest, would breathe, would let the calm settle, would let the scales balance, would let the burden rest.

Tomorrow he would face the east fort, and the men who might listen, and the hope of balance, of protection, of a way forward.

Tomorrow he would begin to understand what it meant to share burden, to balance it, to keep it from breaking everything.

But tonight, he would rest. And for the first time in months, that was enough.
