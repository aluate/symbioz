# Chapter 31

Sela remained in hiding those days, slipping deeper into the woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, her pouch clutched tight, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed.

She carried the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements slow, her steps heavy, her heart breaking, her everything broken. But she'd survived. She'd escaped. She'd found a way to keep moving, to keep running, to keep holding the burden so it didn't break others, so it didn't spread, so it didn't destroy everything.

She'd moved on from her first hiding place, leaving behind her pouch, leaving behind her trust, leaving behind her hope. But she kept moving, kept searching for a place where she could rest, where she could breathe, where she could let the burden settle, if only for a moment.

Taman skulked the forest's edge those days, tormented by visions of Mother in chains, her body bound, her voice silenced, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his betrayal, for his broken trust, for his destroyed hope.

He couldn't sleep. He couldn't rest. He couldn't think of anything but Mother, bound and trapped, and Sela, alone and hunted, and his failure, complete and absolute. He'd betrayed Sela. He'd failed Mother. He'd broken his trust. He'd destroyed his hope. And now he was alone, lost, broken, destroyed.

Arpin paraded through Shadow those days, demanding Sela, building frenzy against her, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, shouting that she must be found, must be brought back, must be given up, must be betrayed, must be broken, must be destroyed.

"The burden must be removed," he shouted. "The poison must be eliminated. The corruption must be destroyed. The curse must be burned. The gift must be broken. The burden must be ended. And she must be found. She must be brought back. She must be given up. She must be betrayed. She must be broken. She must be destroyed."

Boone was torn those days, seeing Sela as a sister but feeling powerless, caught between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen.

He'd failed Mother. He'd failed Sela. He'd failed Taman. He'd failed everyone. And the burden of that failure, that cowardice, that silence—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over love.

Isaac worked his coin constantly now, whispering that the "curse" must be burned from their midst, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, feeling the brass warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"The coin sees," Isaac whispered. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find her. It will root her out. It will bring her back. It always does. It always works."

The missionary muttered half-Bible, half-gibberish those days, confusing even himself, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden.

But sometimes his words were clearer, sharper, as if he was trying to be understood. "The burden follows," he muttered. "The burden always follows. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

The hawk hovered overhead those days, tracking both Taman and Sela, omen of balance, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

At night, Arpin dragged Mother from her cell—his final cruelty just beginning, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp, his actions deliberate.

Taman watched from the shadows, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real. He couldn't help. He couldn't stop them. He could only watch, only stand by, only let it happen.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
