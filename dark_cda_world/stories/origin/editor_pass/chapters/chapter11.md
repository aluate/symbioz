# Chapter 11

The tremor came at dawn, rattling the fort like a beast shaking off sleep. Taman woke to the sound of things falling, of buckets tilting, of a lantern crashing from its hook. The ground moved beneath him, and he felt it in his bones, in the way the walls shook, in the way the whole settlement seemed to groan.

It lasted longer than any tremor before, and when it finally stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous. Taman stepped outside, breathing the morning air, and he saw the damage—buckets overturned, tools scattered, the lantern broken on the ground. Small things, but they felt like signs, like warnings, like the burden building, the scales tipping.

Arpin appeared in the central yard, his expression calm, reasonable. "It's just settling," he said, his voice carrying. "The ground settles sometimes. It's natural. Nothing to worry about. Everyone's just nervous, that's all. The tremors are making people jumpy."

But Taman felt the burden of it pressing down. This wasn't settling. This wasn't natural. This was something deeper, something older, something that went beyond the ground, beyond the settlement, beyond anything Arpin could control.

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of Arpin's voice, by the promise of reassurance. They listened, nodding, relieved, and Taman felt the burden of it all pressing down. They believed Arpin. They trusted him. They didn't see the way the ground was shifting, the way the burden was building, the way the scales were tipping.

Taman stepped forward before he could think better of it. "This isn't settling," he said, his voice firm. "This is the mountain responding. This is the burden building. This is the scales tipping. And if we don't do something, if we don't find a way to share the burden, to balance the scales, then something will break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

The crowd turned to look at him, their expressions shifting—uncertainty, then confusion, then something else. Recognition, maybe. Understanding, maybe. They'd felt the tremors. They'd seen the ash. They'd heard the missionary's warnings. And maybe, just maybe, they were starting to see.

Arpin's smile tightened, though it didn't leave his face. "The mountain is always shifting, Taman. That's what mountains do. They're not responding to us. They're not responding to weight or scales or choices. They're just mountains. They just shift. That's all."

"But these tremors are getting stronger," Taman pressed. He could feel the wrongness pressing back, but he held his ground. "They're lasting longer. They're happening more often. That's not normal. That's not settling. That's something else."

Isaac stepped forward then, his hand in his pocket, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made everything feel inevitable again. But he held his ground, his hand going to his pouch, feeling its familiar weight.

"The tremors are natural," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The ground settles. That's what ground does. And Arpin is right—everyone's nervous. The tremors are making people jumpy. That's all. Nothing to worry about."

But Taman could see the change in the crowd—uncertainty where there had been certainty, questions where there had been answers. He'd spoken truth, and truth had weight. And even though Isaac's coin was still working, still bending things, some of that truth had stuck.

Boone found Taman at the edge of the yard later, his expression troubled. "I know it's hard," he said, his voice low. "I know the burden is building. I can feel it too. But we have to be patient. The ledgers will one day free us. They'll show us the way. They'll give us the tools we need to change things. We just have to wait. We just have to be smart."

Taman looked at him, saw the way he held the ledger under his arm like a shield, saw the way he believed in the numbers, in the system, in the promise of freedom through accounting. And he wanted to believe it too. He wanted to believe that the ledgers could free them, that patience could change things, that being smart could protect them.

But he'd seen how Arpin used the ledgers, how Isaac's coin bent things, how every page was a chain, every signature a cage. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that the ledgers wouldn't free them. They would only bind them tighter, only create more burden, only tip the scales further.

"Every page is a chain, Boone," Taman said. "Every signature is a cage. The ledgers won't free us. They'll only bind us tighter."

Boone shook his head, his expression troubled. "You're wrong, Taman. The ledgers are tools. They're maps. They show us where we stand, what we owe, what's owed to us. And if we understand them, if we learn to use them, then we can change things. We can make them work for us instead of against us."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to explain, wanted to make Boone see. But he knew it wouldn't help. Boone believed in the ledgers, believed in the system, believed in the promise of freedom through accounting. And nothing Taman could say would change that. Not yet. Not like this.

He found Sela later that morning, at the edge of the settlement, looking out toward the timber. Her expression was troubled, her hands steady at her sides, and Taman felt the burden of the moment pressing down.

"We have to do something," Taman said. "We can't just stand by and watch. The burden is building. The scales are tipping. If we don't act, if we don't find a way to share the burden, to balance the scales, then something will break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "I know, Taman. I know the burden is building. I can feel it too. But we can't confront Arpin outright. Not yet. Not like this. If we do, we'll be beaten, locked away, just like Hiram. And that won't help anyone. That won't change anything."

Taman felt frustration building. "Then what? What do we do? We can't just wait. We can't just stand by. The burden is building, and if we don't do something, something will break."

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the burden from breaking. But we have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to find another way. A way that doesn't put us at risk. A way that doesn't make things worse."

"Then I'll find a way," Taman said, making a choice. "I'll find help. I'll find people who understand balance, who share weight, who can help us tip the scales the right way."

Sela looked at him, her expression troubled but understanding. "And if you do? What then? How do we break Arpin's grip? How do we share the burden? How do we balance the scales?"

"I don't know," Taman admitted. "But I have to try. I have to find a way. I can't just stand by and watch everything break."

Sela nodded, her expression steady. "Then you'll try. And when you find a way, we'll be here. We'll be ready. We'll help you tip the scales the right way."

That night, Taman dreamed of a road.

It was a clear path, leading out of the valley, away from the settlement, away from Arpin, away from the burden. The road was smooth, well-traveled, and it promised freedom, escape, a way out, a way to find help, a way to share weight, a way to balance scales.

In the dream, he walked the road, feeling the burden lift from his shoulders, feeling the scales balance, feeling the world right itself. The settlement faded behind him, and the mountain faded, and everything felt light, free, balanced.

He woke with the dream still fresh in his mind, the road clear, the path obvious. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that he had to find it. He had to leave. He had to go east. He had to find help, find people who understood balance, who shared weight, who could help them tip the scales the right way.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the burden accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
