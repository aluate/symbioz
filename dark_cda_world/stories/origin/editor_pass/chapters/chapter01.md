# Chapter 1

Morning broke soft over Fort Shadow, the kind that made the world feel new and the night's worries feel small. Taman moved through the timber with Sela at his side, their boots quiet on the needle-carpeted ground. The mountain Olayah loomed above them, its peak still wrapped in mist, and beneath their feet, faint sign led them in a slow, patient circle.

Taman read the ground like most men read words. An elk had passed here, maybe two hours gone. The tracks were clear enough—deep prints in the soft earth, broken twigs where it had pushed through underbrush. But something about the pattern nagged at him. The animal wasn't moving toward water or away from danger. It was just circling, lazy and deliberate, as if marking time.

"You see it too," Sela said, not a question.

Taman nodded without looking up. His sister had a way of knowing what he was thinking without him saying it. She walked a few paces behind him, letting him lead, but her presence steadied him. Always had. He felt most himself in the quiet—the hawk overhead making slow, patient loops, the pollen haze that hung in the air like gold dust, and that low ground-hum he couldn't name but had learned to trust. The vibration ran through his bootsoles, steady as a heartbeat. It meant balance was holding, things were as they should be.

He paused, studying the tracks more closely. Something felt wrong. He knelt and pressed his palm flat against the earth. The vibration was steady, but beneath it, he sensed something else—a faint tremor, like the mountain was stirring in its sleep.

"We should head back," Sela said. Her voice was calm, steady. She didn't need to explain why. The sun was climbing, and there was work waiting at the palisade. But more than that, she could feel the burden of the morning pressing down, the way she always could when things were about to shift.

Taman straightened and looked at her. Sela was two years older, but she carried herself like someone who'd seen twice that. Her dark hair was braided back, practical, and her hands were steady at her sides. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. She could take the burden of a room, of a moment, of a choice, and keep it from spilling over. Taman had seen her do it a hundred times—calm a dispute, soothe a frightened child, steady a man who was about to do something he'd regret.

But gifts had costs. Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching. He'd seen the way she went quiet for days after holding too much, as if the words had been pressed out of her. It left her hollow, drained, but she never complained.

"The tracks don't make sense," Taman said, making a decision. "I want to follow the circle, see where it leads."

Sela's expression shifted slightly—not disapproval, but concern. "The circle leads back to where it started. That's what circles do."

"Maybe." Taman studied the pattern again. "But if the elk chose this path, there's a reason. I need to know what it is."

It was a small act of defiance, choosing to follow his instinct instead of returning to the settlement. But it mattered. Every choice mattered. He could feel it in the way the ground-hum shifted when he made up his mind, in the way Sela's shoulders relaxed slightly as if she'd been holding her breath waiting for him to choose.

"All right," she said, and they continued following the circle together.

By the time the tracks led them back to where they'd started—a full loop, deliberate and complete—the settlement was fully awake. The sound of a smith's hammer rang out, steady and rhythmic. Someone was sawing wood. Children's voices carried from the yard where Sela would spend her afternoon. The place had a rhythm to it, a daily dance that Taman had learned to read as well as he read tracks.

But the rhythm felt off today. He could hear it in the way the hammer struck—too fast, too urgent. He could see it in the way people moved—harried, pressed, as if time itself was tightening around them.

Boone was waiting for them at the gate, a ledger book tucked under his arm. He was a year older than Taman, broad-shouldered and earnest, with a way of looking at the world that made everything seem like a problem waiting to be solved. He'd taken to Arpin's ledgers like a fish to water, learning how numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

"Morning," Boone said, falling into step beside them. His eyes were bright, excited. "Arpin wants to see you, Taman. Something about the flour distribution. I think he's considering you for the distribution ledger. This could be good for us—steady work, credit in the books."

Taman felt a familiar tightness in his chest. Arpin was the trader who'd come to Fort Shadow six months ago, bringing goods and ideas that had changed everything. He was a tall man, well-dressed, with a smile that never quite reached his eyes. He kept ledgers for everything—who owed what, who had credit, who was in good standing. At first, it had seemed like a kindness, a way to help people through lean times. But Taman had watched how those numbers accumulated, how a small debt became a large one, how a favor became an obligation.

"I don't want the ledger," Taman said, making another choice. "I track. That's what I do. Numbers aren't—"

"Numbers are safe," Boone interrupted, his voice urgent. "Numbers are clear. You write them down, they stay written. No one can argue with numbers, Taman. Not when they're in the ledger."

"But people argue with what the numbers mean," Taman said. He'd seen it happen before—Arpin interpreting the numbers one way, someone else seeing them differently. The ledger always won, because Arpin wrote the ledger.

Boone's expression flickered—uncertainty, then resolve. "That's because they don't understand. Once you learn how the system works, you can use it. You can make it work for you."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to explain that systems worked for the people who built them, not for the people who got caught in them. But they were already at the central yard, and there was a scene unfolding that demanded his attention.

A woman named Marta stood with her arms crossed, her face tight with anger. Her husband, a man named Jeb, stood beside her, looking uncomfortable. Arpin was there, calm and reasonable, and Isaac stood just behind him, one hand in his pocket.

"I'm telling you, we paid our share," Marta said, her voice rising. "We gave you three sacks last month, same as everyone else."

"And I'm not disputing that," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "But the ledger shows a discrepancy. According to the records, you received four sacks, not three. The extra one needs to be accounted for."

"That's not right," Jeb said, but his voice lacked conviction. He was looking at Isaac, and Isaac was just standing there, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman watched the exchange, feeling that tightness in his chest grow. He knew Marta. She was honest, hardworking. If she said she'd given three sacks, she'd given three sacks. But Arpin's ledgers had a way of making truth feel flexible, of making people doubt what they knew.

Isaac shifted slightly, and Taman caught a glimpse of something in his pocket—a flash of brass, maybe, or the way the light caught on metal. The man's thumb was moving in a slow, circular motion. As Taman watched, he saw the tension drain out of Marta's shoulders like water from a broken bucket. Her arms uncrossed. Her face softened. Her certainty wavered, then crumbled.

"I suppose," she said slowly, voice gone placid, "if the ledger says so, then maybe I'm mistaken. It was a busy month."

Jeb looked relieved. "Right. Must have been a mistake on our part."

Arpin smiled, the kind of smile that made Taman's skin crawl. "No harm done. We'll just adjust the records. Thank you for understanding."

The matter resolved almost too quickly. One moment, Marta was angry and certain. The next, she was agreeing to something that didn't make sense. Isaac's hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that hidden coin, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that pressure, that wrongness, the way it bent things toward agreement like a magnet pulling iron.

He stepped forward. "Wait."

The word came out sharper than he intended, and everyone turned to look at him. Sela's hand touched his arm—a warning, maybe, or support. He wasn't sure. But he'd made his choice.

"Marta," Taman said, speaking directly to her, cutting through whatever haze Isaac had put on her. "You said you gave three sacks. I believe you. The ledger can be wrong."

Marta blinked, shook her head slightly as if clearing cobwebs. For a moment, her certainty returned—"Yes, three sacks. I counted them myself—" but then Isaac's thumb moved again, and her voice trailed off, uncertainty creeping back.

Arpin's smile didn't falter, but his eyes narrowed slightly. "Taman. How kind of you to join us. But we've already resolved this matter. The ledger has been corrected."

"Has it?" Taman pressed. He could feel the wrongness pressing back now, pushing against his words, trying to make them small and harmless. But he held his ground. "Or has the ledger just been made to say what you want it to say?"

Silence fell over the yard. Even the smith's hammer paused. Taman could hear his own heartbeat, could feel every eye on him. He'd crossed a line, and he knew it. But he couldn't take it back. He wouldn't.

Isaac's hand moved slightly in his pocket, and Taman felt the pressure intensify. The urge to apologize, to back down, to agree that the ledger was right—it pressed against his mind like a physical weight. But he gritted his teeth and stood firm.

Boone grabbed his arm. "Taman, don't. This isn't—"

"It's fine," Arpin said smoothly, cutting Boone off. His smile widened, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Taman has opinions. That's good. Opinions are valuable. But facts are facts, and the ledger records facts. Marta has agreed to the correction. The matter is settled."

Marta and Jeb were already walking away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. They'd forgotten their anger, forgotten their certainty. Taman watched them go, feeling sick.

He'd tried. He'd stood up. But it hadn't mattered. Isaac's coin had bent the moment anyway, had made his words meaningless.

Arpin turned to him. "Come, Taman. Boone mentioned you might be interested in learning the ledger system. I think you'd find it enlightening. Numbers don't lie, after all."

Taman shook his head. "I track. That's what I do. I don't need to learn numbers."

Another choice. Small, but it mattered. He could feel it in the way Arpin's smile tightened, in the way Isaac's hand moved in his pocket again. But this time, the pressure bounced off. Sela was beside him, steady and calm, and her presence seemed to absorb the wrongness, to keep it from touching him.

"Very well," Arpin said, his voice still smooth, still pleasant. But his eyes promised this wasn't over. "Perhaps another time."

That night, after the settlement had quieted, Taman sat in the dark of his small room and fingered his battered pouch. It was old, hand-stitched by Sela years ago from scraps of leather and cloth. Empty, but it had a presence he'd learned to trust. When things got too heavy, when the choices piled up and threatened to break him, he could put his hand on the pouch and feel it steady him, feel it absorb some of the burden so he could breathe.

But tonight, the pouch felt different. Tighter, maybe. As if it was holding something he couldn't see. As if it was already full of tomorrow's choices.

He thought about the elk tracks, about that slow circle in the timber. He thought about Isaac's coin, about the way it made people agree. He thought about Arpin's ledgers, about how numbers could bind people tighter than rope. He thought about the choices he'd made today—following the circle instead of turning back, speaking up when he should have stayed silent.

The circle is only the elk's, he told himself. Not mine.

But even as he thought it, he felt the day pressing down, felt the way things were shifting. The ground-hum was still there, steady as a heartbeat, but something felt different. Thinner, maybe. As if balance was holding—but for how long?

Outside, the hawk was silent. The mountain Olayah loomed in the darkness, its peak hidden in cloud. And somewhere in the distance, Taman thought he heard the sound of scales shifting, of choices accumulating, of something building that couldn't be stopped.

He put his hand on the pouch and tried to steady himself. But the burden kept building, and he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that something was coming. Something that would change everything.

The circle was closing. He could feel it. And this time, when it closed, he'd be standing inside it.
