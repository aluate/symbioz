# Chapter 5

Two days after meeting Coyote, Taman made up his mind. He'd been thinking about it since the spring, since seeing his reflection split, since talking with Coyote about choices and weight. He couldn't stay here. He couldn't be part of Arpin's system, couldn't let himself be bound by ledgers and debts and obligations. He had to leave.

He found Boone at the edge of the settlement, sitting on a crate with Arpin's ledgers spread around him. His expression was troubled, and Taman felt a pang of guilt. He'd been pressing Boone about the ledgers, about the system, about the weight that was building. But Boone believed in it, believed that it could keep them safe, believed that numbers could protect them.

"Boone," Taman said, sitting beside him. "I need to talk to you."

Boone looked up, his expression uncertain. "Taman. What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong," Taman said. "But I'm leaving. I'm going east, away from here, away from Arpin, away from the ledgers. And I want you to come with me."

Boone's expression shifted—uncertainty, then worry, then something else. Fear, maybe. "Taman, what are you talking about? We have a good thing here. Arpin's building something, something that will last. The ledgers show it. The numbers prove it. Why would we leave?"

"Because it's not safe," Taman said, his voice firm. He'd made his choice, and he had to make Boone understand. "Because the burden is building. Because something's coming, and I don't want to be here when it arrives. And I don't want you to be here either."

Boone shook his head. "You're worrying about nothing. The tremors? Arpin said it's just settling. The missionary? He's a madman. The ledgers? They're keeping us safe. Everything's accounted for, everything's balanced. That's how we stay safe."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the ledgers could keep them safe, that the numbers could protect them. But he'd seen how Arpin used them, how Isaac's coin bent things toward agreement, how gratitude became obligation, how debts became chains.

"It's not about the ledgers," Taman said. "It's about the burden. It's about the choices we're making, the way things are shifting. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest but troubled. "I see a future, Taman. I see roads and routes and wagons. I see a system that works, that keeps people safe, that gives them what they need. That's what I see. And I'm not going to walk away from that."

Taman felt the burden of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to leave. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in the ledgers, in the numbers, in the future Arpin was promising. He couldn't see the burden building, couldn't feel the way things were shifting, because he didn't want to. The ledgers told him everything was fine, and he believed them.

"All right," Taman said, making another choice. "But I'm going. With or without you. And I want you to know—you're welcome to come. You're welcome to change your mind. But I'm not staying. I can't stay."

Boone's expression shifted again—worry, then something harder. "Taman, you can't. Arpin won't let you. You're part of the system now. You have obligations, debts. You can't just walk away."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Obligations. Debts. The words felt heavy, felt like chains. He'd been careful, had tried to stay out of Arpin's system, but maybe it was too late. Maybe he was already bound, already part of the ledger, already weighed down by choices he hadn't known he was making.

But he'd made a choice now. He'd decided to leave. And that choice had weight. And he was going to bear that weight, whether Arpin liked it or not.

"I have to try," Taman said, standing up. "I'm going to the gate. I'm going to tell them I'm leaving. And if they try to stop me, I'll find another way. But I'm not staying. I've made my choice."

He found Arpin in the central yard, talking with Isaac. The trader looked up as Taman approached, his smile widening, but it still didn't reach his eyes.

"Taman," Arpin said. "Good to see you. I was just talking about you. We have plans, big plans, and I think you'd be perfect for them. There's a route east that needs scouting, and you're the best tracker we have. What do you say?"

Taman felt the burden of the moment pressing down. Arpin was offering him a way out, but it wasn't really a way out. It was a way to bind him tighter, to make him part of the system, to create obligations he couldn't escape.

"No," Taman said, making his choice clear. "I don't want to scout a route. I don't want to be part of your plans. I want to leave. I want to go east, on my own. No routes, no scouting, no obligations. Just me, leaving."

Arpin's smile didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. Cold, calculating. "I understand the desire for freedom, Taman. I really do. But you're part of this settlement now. You have responsibilities, obligations. The ledger shows it. You've received goods, credit, protection. That creates a debt, and debts need to be settled."

Taman felt the chill deepen. The ledger. The numbers. The way everything was accounted for, the way every kindness became a debt, the way every gift became a chain.

"I never asked for any of that," Taman said, his voice firm. "I never asked for your goods, your credit, your protection. I never signed your ledger. I never agreed to your system."

"But you received it," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "And receiving creates obligation. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair. You can't just take and leave. You have to balance the scales."

Isaac stood behind Arpin, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman felt the shift in the air—that wrongness, that pressure—the way it made Arpin's words feel inevitable, the way it made the moment feel like it had already been decided.

But Taman had made his choice. He'd decided to leave. And he wasn't going to let Isaac's coin change that.

"I'm leaving," Taman said, his voice firm. He could feel the pressure intensifying, could feel the wrongness pressing back. But he gritted his teeth and held his ground. "Whether you like it or not. Whether the ledger says so or not. I'm leaving."

Arpin's smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Not until your debts are settled. The ledger is clear on that. But don't worry—we can work something out. There's always a way to balance the scales."

"Then we'll work something out," Taman said, making another choice. "But I'm leaving today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today. And if you try to stop me, I'll find another way. But I'm not staying."

He turned and walked away, leaving Arpin and Isaac behind. He could feel the weight of their attention on his back, could feel the wrongness pressing against him. But he held his ground, kept walking, kept moving forward.

The burden was building, and he could feel it in his bones, in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited. But he'd made his choice. He was leaving. And that choice had weight. And he was going to bear that weight.

He made it to the gate before they stopped him. Isaac was already there, his hand in his pocket, and Arpin was close behind. The guards at the gate shifted, uncertain, but Isaac's presence made them stand firm.

"Taman," Arpin said, his voice smooth. "I think we need to talk about this. Your leaving would create a shortage. We need trackers. We need people we can trust. You can't just walk away and leave us with a gap."

"That's not my problem," Taman said, his voice firm. He could feel the pressure intensifying, could feel Isaac's coin working, could feel the wrongness pressing back. But he held his ground. "I'm leaving. That's my choice. You can't stop me."

"But we can," Arpin said, his smile finally dropping. "The ledger shows a debt. Until that debt is settled, you're bound to this settlement. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair."

Taman felt the burden of it pressing down. He was trapped. The ledgers had bound him, the numbers had chained him, and he couldn't escape. Not without settling debts he'd never known he was making, not without balancing scales that had been tipped without his consent.

But he'd made his choice. He was leaving. And he wasn't going to let Arpin's system stop him.

"I'm leaving," he said again, his voice firm. "Whether you like it or not. Whether the ledger says so or not. I'm leaving."

He pushed past the guards, past Isaac, past Arpin. The pressure intensified, the wrongness pressed back, but he kept moving forward. He'd made his choice. He was leaving. And that choice had weight.

But just as he reached the gate, the sky began to darken.

Clouds rolled in from the west, heavy and gray, and the air grew thick with the promise of rain. By evening, the storm had arrived, and it was worse than any Taman had seen before.

The wind howled, tearing at the palisade, rattling the buildings. Rain fell in sheets, turning the ground to mud, and lightning split the sky, illuminating the settlement in flashes of white light. The thunder was constant, a low rumble that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Taman stood in the doorway of his small room, watching the storm rage. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by something else—something heavy, something dangerous. The burden was building, and the storm felt like a response, like the world was reacting to the imbalance, to his choice, to his attempt to leave.

The settlement hunkered down, waiting for the storm to pass. People moved through the rain, securing buildings, checking on neighbors, doing what they could to ride it out. But Taman felt the burden of it, felt the way things were shifting, felt the way the storm wasn't just weather—it was something more.

It was a response. A warning, maybe. Or a promise. Either way, it was keeping him here, trapping him just as surely as the ledgers had trapped him.

By morning, the storm had passed. The sun returned, weak and pale, and the settlement began to emerge from the wreckage. Buildings were damaged, the ground was mud, and people moved slowly, as if the storm had taken something from them.

But it was the wind that caught Taman's attention. When the sun returned, the wind carried a scent he'd never smelled before—ash. Not wood ash, not fire ash, but something else. Something that smelled of the mountain, of something deep and old and waiting.

Ash-scented wind, when there was no fire.

Taman stood in the central yard, breathing it in, and he felt the burden of it pressing down. The storm had passed, but something else was coming. The ash-scented wind was a warning, a sign that the burden was building, that the scales were tipping, that something was about to break.

The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream. And the wind carried the scent of ash, and Taman knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that this was just the beginning.

He'd tried to leave. He'd made his choice. But the storm had stopped him, had trapped him here, had added its own weight to his burden. And now the ash-scented wind was a warning—a promise, maybe—that something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the burden accumulated, and something was coming.

He'd made his choice. He'd tried to leave. But the world had other plans. And now he was trapped here, bound by storm and ash and the weight of his own choices.

The circle was closing. And he was standing inside it.
