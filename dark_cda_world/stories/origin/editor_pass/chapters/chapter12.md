# Chapter 12

Taman found himself at the missionary's chapel the next morning, drawn by desperation and the memory of Boone's silence, of Arpin's tightening grip, of the burden building with nowhere to go. The chapel stood at the edge of the settlement, crooked and weathered, a small structure that seemed to lean away from the fort as if trying to escape the burden pressing down.

He hesitated at the door, his hand on the rough wood, and he could hear the missionary's voice inside, muttering, chanting, speaking to walls that didn't answer back. The sound was familiar, a rhythm he'd heard before—half prayer, half madness, all burden.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The missionary sat on a low stool in the corner, his gaunt frame hunched over a worn Bible, his fingers tracing words that seemed to shift under his touch. He wore dark clothes that hung loose on his thin body, and he moved like a shade even when still, as if he existed half in this world and half in another.

"Ah," the missionary said without looking up. "The tracker returns. The boy who follows circles. The one who carries burden in his pouch and fear in his heart."

Taman stepped closer, his boots scuffing the dirt floor. "I need guidance. I need direction. Boone won't stand with me. Arpin's grip is tightening. The burden is building, and I don't know what to do."

The missionary looked up then, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing things Taman couldn't see. But for a moment, they were clearer, more focused, as if he was trying to be understood. "Direction?" he said, his voice rising. "You want direction? I'll give you direction. The scales are tipping. The mountain is listening. The burden shifts, and you carry it, and you will carry it until it breaks you or you break it."

He stood abruptly, his movements jerky, unsteady, and he began to pace the small space, muttering, gesturing, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"Scales and sin," he said. "Burden and wickedness. Christ's cross was heavy, boy. Heavy as mountains. Heavy as the burden you carry. Heavy as the burden your sister carries. Christ's cross was no lighter than your sister's. No lighter. No lighter at all."

Taman felt frustration building. He'd come for answers, for clarity, for something he could use, something he could act on. But the missionary's words were riddles wrapped in madness, warnings without direction, prophecies without paths.

"The mountain watches," the missionary continued, his voice rising, cracking. "The mountain waits. The scales tip, and the burden accumulates, and when it breaks, it breaks everything. Fire and ash and the split. The split comes. The split always comes."

He stopped pacing and turned to face Taman directly, his eyes wild with something that looked like fear and prophecy mixed together. But then something shifted—clarity, maybe, or recognition. "You think you can escape it? You think you can outrun it? The burden follows. The burden always follows. It's part of you now. Part of what you carry. Part of who you are."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand something useful, something actionable. But the missionary's words, though mad, rang with a truth that made his chest tight. The burden did follow. It was part of him. He'd known it, felt it, carried it. And running wouldn't help. Running never helped.

"But maybe there's a way to share it," Taman said, making a choice. "Maybe there's a way to balance it. Maybe there's a place where burden is shared, where scales are level, where people work together instead of against each other."

The missionary's expression shifted, becoming thoughtful. For once, his eyes were clear, focused. "Maybe. Maybe there is such a place. Maybe the east. Maybe beyond the mountain. Maybe where people understand balance, where they share weight, where they know that burden is meant to be carried together, not alone."

He looked at Taman, his eyes seeing something that made his expression soften. "I keep a wagon. Bound for the east fort. I know men there. Men who will listen. Men who understand balance. Men who see the burden and know what it means."

Taman felt something shift in his chest. The east fort. The road from his dream. The escape he'd been seeking. "When?" he said. "When do you leave?"

The missionary hesitated, his eyes shifting, looking past Taman toward the door, and Taman felt something change in the air, something shift, something heavy pressing down.

"Soon," the missionary said, his voice faltering. "Soon. But you must be careful. You must be quiet. The burden follows. The burden always follows."

And then, as if on cue, Taman heard footsteps outside, heard the sound of someone approaching the chapel, and he felt the burden in the air shift, felt something press down, felt something squeeze.

The missionary's voice cut off mid-verse, as if unseen fingers had pinched it shut. His mouth worked, but no sound came out. His eyes widened, and he looked at Taman with something that looked like fear, like recognition, like understanding of what was coming.

Taman turned toward the door, and he saw Isaac walking past the chapel, his hand buried deep in his pocket, his thumb working something there—something brass, something that caught the light like fire. Isaac didn't look at the chapel, didn't glance toward the door, but his presence was enough, his coin was enough, to silence the missionary's voice, to choke his words, to press the burden down until even madness couldn't speak.

Isaac passed by, and the missionary's voice returned, shaky, uncertain, but the moment had changed. The burden had shifted. The scales had tipped.

"The coin," the missionary whispered, his voice barely audible. "The coin bends truth. The coin bends words. The coin bends even verses. Even mine. Even God's."

He looked at Taman, his eyes wild with fear and understanding. "Be careful, boy. Be careful. The coin sees. The coin hears. The coin knows. And if you go east, if you take my wagon, the coin will know. The burden will know. And it will follow."

But Taman had already made up his mind. The road. The east fort. The escape. It was what he'd dreamed of. What he'd been seeking. And he wasn't going to let riddles and warnings stop him. He wasn't going to let fear stop him. He wasn't going to let the burden stop him.

"I'll take it," Taman said. "I'll take the wagon. I'll go east. I'll find the men who listen. I'll find the balance. I'll find a way to share the burden, to balance the scales, to break Arpin's grip."

The missionary looked at him, his expression troubled, his eyes seeing things Taman couldn't see. "The burden follows," he said again. "The burden always follows. But maybe. Maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance, maybe there's a way. Maybe there's hope."

Taman felt something shift, something change. The road. The path. The escape. It was real. It was possible. And he was going to take it.

He left the chapel with the missionary's words ringing in his ears, with the burden pressing down, with the knowledge that Isaac's coin had heard, had seen, had known. But he didn't care. He was going east. He was going to find help. He was going to find a way to share the burden, to balance the scales, to break the circle, break the chains, break the burden that was crushing them all.

The burden would follow. He knew that now. The burden always followed. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understood balance, maybe he could find a way to share it, to bear it, to break it.

Maybe he could find a way to save them all.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the burden accumulated, and Isaac's coin glowed faintly in the darkness, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
