# Chapter 32

Isaac watched Arpin take his "pound of flesh" from Mother in silence that night, his breathing ragged as he slunk into shadow to clean himself, whispering "balance" as if it absolved him, as if it justified him, as if it made everything right.

But balance didn't absolve. Balance didn't justify. Balance didn't make things right. Balance just weighed. Balance just shifted. Balance just tipped. And every weight, every shift, every tip—it all added up. It all accumulated. It all brought the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that would break.

Isaac felt something shift in his chest, felt the burden of what he'd witnessed pressing down. He'd watched Arpin take his pound of flesh, watched him kill Mother, watched him claim it was balance, claim it was justice, claim it was right. And maybe, just maybe, he was starting to see. Maybe, just maybe, he was starting to question. Maybe, just maybe, balance didn't justify everything. Maybe, just maybe, balance had cost too much.

Arpin finished and, with chilling tenderness, cradled Mother's head, telling her the pain has been paid, the debt has been cleared, the obligation has been met, the burden has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored.

"It's done," he said, his voice soft, gentle, kind. "The pain is paid. The debt is cleared. The obligation is met. The burden is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored."

But she was not free. She was not released. She was not safe. She was dead. She was broken. She was destroyed. And her last words cursed him, her voice weak, her words careful, her breath coming in gasps.

"Burden will find you," she whispered. "Balance will find you. Truth will find you. And when it does, when it finds you, when it comes due, you will pay. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Arpin killed her gently then, claiming mercy, his movements careful, his actions deliberate, his words soft, his voice kind.

Boone heard but did nothing, his cowardice hardening into a burden of its own, his silence becoming a debt, his inaction becoming an obligation.

He'd heard Mother's cries. He'd heard her last words. He'd heard her curse Arpin. And he'd done nothing. He'd said nothing. He'd just stood there, frozen, paralyzed, powerless, watching, listening, letting it happen.

And the burden of that, the shame of that, the guilt of that—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over love.

Arpin told the town the debt is settled the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, saying the burden has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored.

But Isaac stepped forward, coin glowing faintly, insisting the mountain will keep cracking until Sela's blood feeds the scales, her burden is removed, her gift is broken.

"The debt is settled," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The burden is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored. But the mountain still groans. The earth still shakes. The scales still tip. And they will keep groaning, keep shaking, keep tipping, until Sela's blood feeds the scales, until her burden is removed, until her gift is broken."

Arpin seized the turn, declaring Sela's death balance due, whipping the crowd toward frenzy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his movements confident.

"Sela's death will balance the scales," he shouted. "Her sacrifice will restore the balance. Her blood will feed the mountain. Her burden will be removed. Her gift will be broken. And then everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced."

The trio flanked him then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—their silent menace sealing the square, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate.

The mountain groaned audibly through the squareboards then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, and even the bravest men looked at their feet, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if the mountain itself was speaking, was judging, was promising something that would break.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
