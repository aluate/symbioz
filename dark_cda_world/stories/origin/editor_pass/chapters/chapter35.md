# Chapter 35

The trio cornered Sela and dragged her back in chains that morning, Kerrick grinning, Silas looping rope, Marlowe silent as knives, their movements quick, their hands rough, their voices loud.

She'd been caught. She'd been captured. She'd been brought back. And now she was bound, was trapped, was caught in chains she couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

Boone watched, tears streaking his face, his complicity a wound that won't close, his betrayal complete, his trust broken, his hope destroyed.

He'd led them. He'd shown them. He'd betrayed her. He'd broken her. He'd destroyed her. And now she was caught, was bound, was trapped. And it was all his fault. He'd betrayed her. He'd broken her. He'd destroyed her. And the shame of that, the guilt of that, the burden of that—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd become, what he'd chosen.

Arpin declared balance must be restored that afternoon, saying Sela's sacrifice will seal it, the burden will be shared, the scales will be tipped, the something will be resolved.

"Balance must be restored," he shouted. "The burden must be shared. The scales must be tipped. The something must be resolved. And Sela's sacrifice will seal it. Her death will restore it. Her blood will feed it. Her burden will shift it. Her scale will tip it. Her balance will restore it."

The town, half-hypnotized, nodded along, their voices rising, their movements agreeing, their wills bending.

They believed him. They trusted him. They nodded along, agreeing that Sela's sacrifice would restore balance, would share burden, would tip scales. They were caught in Isaac's coin, bound by Arpin's words, trapped in their own fear, their own desperation, their own need to believe that sacrifice would save them.

Isaac whispered scripture twisted into law that evening, coin hot in his hand, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"The sacrifice is necessary," Isaac whispered. "The death is required. The blood is needed. The burden must be shared. The scales must be tipped. The balance must be restored. And Sela's sacrifice will do it. Her death will restore it. Her blood will feed it."

Coyote mocked Taman for trusting the missionary's babble that night, calling him a fool who listens to ghosts that don't know their own tongue, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate.

"You trusted the missionary's babble," Coyote teased. "You listened to ghosts that don't know their own tongue. You believed in prophecies that don't understand their own words. And where did that get you? Nowhere. Lost. Broken. Destroyed."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. Coyote was right. He'd trusted. He'd listened. He'd believed. And it had gotten him nowhere. Lost. Broken. Destroyed.

The missionary howled garbled verse that evening, convincing none but unsettling all, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden.

But sometimes his words were clearer, sharper, as if he was trying to be understood. "The burden follows," the missionary howled. "The burden always follows. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Taman reached Shadow's edge that night, breathless and bloodied, too late again, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real.

He'd failed. He'd arrived too late. He'd failed to save Sela. He'd failed to stop the sacrifice. He'd failed to restore balance. He'd failed to share burden. He'd failed everything.

Sela called his name then, not in fear but in forgiveness, her voice soft, her words careful, her movements slow.

"Taman," she called. "Taman, I forgive you. I forgive you for betraying me. I forgive you for breaking me. I forgive you for destroying me. I forgive you for everything."

And it broke him deeper than any blow, her forgiveness sharper than any blade, her trust harder than any stone, her hope heavier than any burden.

She'd forgiven him. She'd forgiven his betrayal, his broken trust, his destroyed hope. She'd forgiven everything. And that forgiveness—it broke him. It destroyed him. It remade him.

The ground cracked beneath the fort that evening, the mountain's true answer gathering in its throat, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
