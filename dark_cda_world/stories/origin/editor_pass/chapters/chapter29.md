# Chapter 29

Sela slipped deeper into the woods that night, unseen, unheard, untracked, carrying the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed.

She'd trusted him, believed in him, hoped in him, waited for him, sent him a sign, a message, a trust, believing he wouldn't betray her, wouldn't give her up, wouldn't break her, wouldn't destroy her.

But he had. He'd betrayed her. He'd given her up. He'd broken her. He'd destroyed her. He'd led Arpin's posse to her hiding place, to her secret, to her trust, to her hope, to her everything.

And now she was alone, deeper in the woods, farther from safety, closer to danger, carrying the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed.

But she'd moved on. She'd slipped away. She'd escaped into the deeper woods, leaving behind her pouch, leaving behind her trust, leaving behind her hope. She'd survived. She'd escaped. She'd found a way to keep moving, to keep running, to keep holding the burden so it didn't break others, so it didn't spread, so it didn't destroy everything.

Taman returned to Shadow that evening, a pariah, an outcast, a betrayer, a breaker of trust, a destroyer of hope.

The townsfolk hissed his name as traitor, their voices sharp, their words cutting, their eyes watching, their movements turning away, their trust broken, their hope destroyed.

"Traitor," they hissed. "Betrayer. Breaker of trust. Destroyer of hope. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away. They were right. He was a traitor. He was a betrayer. He'd broken his trust. He'd destroyed his hope. And he'd pay for it. Sooner or later, he'd pay for it.

Boone confronted him that night, fury in his voice, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his trust broken, his hope destroyed.

"You sold her out," Boone shouted. "You betrayed her. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her. And for what? For nothing. For a bargain that was broken. For a trust that was destroyed. For a hope that was gone."

Taman tried to explain, his voice weak, his words careful, his everything broken, his trust destroyed, his hope gone.

"She escaped," Taman said, his voice tight. "I led them to her hiding place, but she'd already moved on. She'd slipped away. She'd escaped. She's safe. She's free. She's whole."

But Boone shook his head, his expression hard, his eyes seeing something that made Taman's chest ache. "It doesn't matter that she escaped. It matters that you betrayed her. It matters that you led them to her. It matters that you broke your trust. It matters that you destroyed your hope. And that's a burden you'll carry. That's a debt you'll pay. That's a choice you'll have to live with."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the burden of Boone's words pressing down. He was right. It didn't matter that Sela had escaped. It mattered that he'd betrayed her. It mattered that he'd broken his trust. It mattered that he'd destroyed his hope. And that was a burden he'd carry. That was a debt he'd pay. That was a choice he'd have to live with.

Mother, bruised and bloodied, was still not released that evening, still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of, Arpin claiming Sela's capture is the only price, her burden the only debt, her gift the only obligation, her death the only payment.

"He broke the bargain," Arpin said, his voice hard. "He didn't bring her back. He didn't give her up. He led us to an empty place, to a broken promise, to a failed bargain. And until she's captured, until she's brought back, until she's given up, your mother stays bound. Your mother stays trapped. Your mother stays caught in chains she can't break, can't escape, can't be free of."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt rage rising, felt the burden of his failure pressing down. He'd failed. He'd failed to protect Sela. He'd failed to save Mother. He'd failed to keep his trust. He'd failed to hold his ground. And now Mother was still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break. And it was all his fault. It was all because of his betrayal, his broken trust, his destroyed hope.

The missionary clasped his Bible tighter, speaking of Judas and silver, his sermons striking too close, his words cutting, his warnings sharp, his prophecies heavy.

"Judas betrayed for silver," the missionary muttered, his voice carrying. "And he paid. He paid with his life, with his soul, with his everything. And you? You betrayed for a bargain, for a promise, for a hope that was broken. And you'll pay. You'll pay with your trust, with your hope, with your everything. Sooner or later, you'll pay."

Isaac's coin gleamed in torchlight, as if mocking Taman, its brass surface catching the light, reflecting the flames, showing fractured images, broken reflections, as if the coin saw, heard, knew, understood the betrayal, the broken trust, the destroyed hope.

Alone in the night, Taman fled into the woods, chasing shadows of Sela and Coyote alike, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed.

He'd failed. He'd betrayed Sela. He'd broken his trust. He'd destroyed his hope. And Mother was still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break. And it was all his fault. It was all because of his choices, his burden, his debt, his obligation.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
