# Chapter 33

Taman fled to the east fort that morning, desperate for soldiers or allies to stop the sacrifice, his movements urgent, his voice tight, his words pleading, begging for help, for protection, for salvation.

The east fort thrived—animals healthy, water clear, air clean, people happy, scales balanced, burden shared, everything as it should be, everything as it could be.

But its commander refused to meddle in Shadow's self-made storm, his voice polite but firm, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying that Fort Shadow was not their concern, that they could not risk their own balance for someone else's burden.

"We cannot meddle," the commander said, his voice careful. "We cannot interfere. We cannot risk our balance for someone else's burden. We have our own people to protect, our own choices to make. And Fort Shadow? Fort Shadow made its own choices. Fort Shadow created its own burden. Fort Shadow tipped its own scales. And Fort Shadow must bear its own consequences."

Taman begged the missionary, who rambled of lambs, Judas, and debts unpaid, offering nothing but noise, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden.

But sometimes his words were clearer, sharper, as if he was trying to be understood. "The burden follows," the missionary muttered. "The burden always follows. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Boone arrived secretly that evening, telling Taman that Mother is gone, and Sela will be taken within days, his voice tight, his words careful, his movements slow.

"She's dead, Taman," Boone said, his voice breaking. "Mother's dead. Arpin killed her. He took his pound of flesh. He called it balance. He called it justice. And she's dead. And Sela—Sela will be taken. Within days. They'll find her. They'll capture her. They'll sacrifice her. And it's all my fault. I led them. I showed them. I betrayed her. I broke her. I destroyed her."

Taman collapsed then, his betrayal echoing Judas' thrice denial, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed.

He'd failed. He'd failed to protect Sela. He'd failed to save Mother. He'd failed to keep his trust. He'd failed to hold his ground. And now Mother was dead. And Sela would be captured. And it was all his fault. It was all because of his betrayal, his broken trust, his destroyed hope.

The hawk's shadow crossed his hands then, dark and heavy, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come.

The tribe listened but held their balance, saying they will neither aid Arpin nor take up arms against him, their voice calm, their words careful, their movements deliberate.

"Our balance is our own," an elder said, her voice steady. "Our burden is our own. We will protect our people, and we will share burden with those who share with us, but we will not risk our balance for another's war."

Mercenaries already leaned Arpin's way that evening, Isaac's whispers having reached even here, his coin working its magic, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

Taman turned back anyway, unwilling to leave Sela to the knife, his movements desperate, his voice tight, his words careful.

He'd failed. He'd betrayed. He'd broken. He'd destroyed. But maybe, just maybe, he could still save Sela. Maybe, just maybe, he could still make it right. Maybe, just maybe, he could still choose differently, act differently, be different.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
