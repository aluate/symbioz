# Chapter 8

The next morning, Taman found Boone at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers. The sun was high overhead, but the day felt heavy, wrong, and Taman could still see Hiram's blood in the dust, could still hear the crowd cheering, could still feel the burden of his own inaction.

"We have to do something," Taman said, not bothering with pleasantries. "We can't just stand by and watch. Hiram spoke the truth, and Arpin beat him for it. If we don't stand against this, we're complicit."

Boone looked up from the ledger, his expression troubled. "I know, Taman. I know it's wrong. But what can we do? Arpin has the crowd. Isaac's coin has them. If we stand against him now, we'll be next. We'll be the ones beaten, the ones locked away."

"Then we'll be beaten," Taman said, making a choice. "But at least we'll have stood up. At least we'll have spoken truth. At least we'll have tried."

Boone closed the ledger and set it aside. His expression shifted—uncertainty, then conflict, then something else. Shame, maybe. "You already spoke up. You already tried. And what happened? Nothing. The crowd still cheered. Hiram still got beaten. Nothing changed."

"But I tried," Taman said. "And that matters. That has weight. And if we keep trying, if we keep speaking truth, then maybe something will change. Maybe people will start to see."

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest, troubled. "I know you're right, Taman. I know the burden is building. I can feel it too. But I also know that if we stand against Arpin now, we'll lose. We'll be beaten, locked away, and nothing will change. But if we play along, if we learn the system, if we understand how it works, then maybe we can find a way to change it from within. Maybe we can protect our family and still make a difference."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that playing along was a strategy, that learning the system was a way to change it. But he'd seen how Arpin worked, how Isaac's coin bent things, how the ledgers bound people. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that playing along wasn't a strategy—it was surrender.

"Boone," Taman said, his voice firm. "Stand with me. Stand with Sela. We can do this together."

Boone shook his head, his expression pained. "I can't, Taman. Not yet. Not like this. I need to protect our family. I need to keep them safe. And right now, that means playing along. That means learning the system. That means waiting for the right moment."

Taman felt the burden of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to stand with him. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in fear, in the need to protect, in the belief that playing along was the only way. And maybe he was right. Maybe standing against Arpin now would only make things worse. But Taman couldn't shake the feeling that doing nothing was also wrong, that silence was complicity, that the burden was building and something had to give.

"Then I'll stand alone," Taman said, making another choice. "But I won't stop. I won't stay silent. I'll keep speaking truth, keep showing people what Arpin's doing, keep trying to tip the scales the right way."

Boone looked at him, his expression troubled, ashamed. "I know you will, Taman. And I wish I could stand with you. But I can't. Not yet. Not like this."

Taman left Boone there, standing at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers, and he felt the burden of the moment pressing down. He needed guidance. He needed wisdom. He needed someone to tell him what to do, how to fight this, how to stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away.

Desperate, he slipped into the missionary's crooked chapel.

It was a small building, tucked away at the edge of the settlement, built from scraps and salvaged wood. The walls were crooked, the roof sagged, and the whole thing looked like it might collapse at any moment. But it was a place of refuge, a place where people came to seek guidance, to find answers, to understand the burden of the world.

The missionary was inside, muttering to himself, his Bible open in his hands. He looked up as Taman entered, his eyes wild, his expression troubled. But then something shifted—recognition, maybe, or clarity.

"Ah," the missionary said, his voice carrying in the small space. "The boy who speaks truth. The one who stands against the weight. Come. Sit. Tell me what troubles you."

Taman sat on a rough bench, feeling the burden of the moment pressing down. "I need to know what to do," he said. "Arpin is wrong. His rule is wrong. But if I stand against him, I'll be beaten, locked away, just like Hiram. And if I don't, I'm complicit. I'm part of the problem. What do I do?"

The missionary looked at him for a long moment, his expression shifting, becoming thoughtful. For once, his eyes were clear, focused. "Names weigh more than sins," he said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "That's what you need to understand. Names carry burden. Speaking them with meaning, with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. And even Christ stumbled under His Cross. Even He bore the burden. But He bore it. He didn't run from it. He didn't hide from it. He faced it, and He bore it."

Taman felt the burden of those words pressing down. Names weigh more than sins. Even Christ stumbled under His Cross. The words felt like truth, like guidance. What did they mean? How did they help? What was he supposed to do?

"But how?" Taman asked. "How do I face it? How do I bear it? How do I stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away?"

The missionary shook his head. "There is no way, boy. There is no path that avoids the burden. You stand, or you don't. You bear it, or you break. That's the choice. That's always been the choice."

Taman felt frustration building. He'd come here for answers, for guidance, for a way forward. But the missionary was giving him truth, giving him choice, giving him burden instead of relief.

"Then what's the point?" Taman asked. "If there's no way to avoid it, if standing means getting beaten, if bearing it means breaking, then what's the point of trying?"

The missionary looked at him, his expression shifting, becoming almost gentle. "The point is the choice, boy. The point is that you choose. You choose to stand, or you choose to run. You choose to bear it, or you choose to break. The burden doesn't care. The scales don't care. But you care. And that's what matters. That's what makes the difference."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand better answers, wanted to find a way forward. But before he could speak, Isaac passed by outside, his hand deep in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

The missionary's voice faltered mid-verse, as though unseen fingers had pinched it shut. He looked toward the door, his expression shifting, becoming troubled, and Taman felt the burden of Isaac's presence, the way it bent things, the way it silenced voices.

"The coin," the missionary whispered, his voice barely audible. "The coin bends things. It makes truth feel flexible. It makes choices feel inevitable. And when it's near, even the words falter. Even the verses fail."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Isaac's coin was powerful, more powerful than he'd realized. It didn't just bend people—it bent truth, it bent words, it bent the very fabric of the moment. And when it was near, even the missionary's voice faltered, even his verses failed.

Isaac moved on, his hand still in his pocket, thumb still working that coin, and the missionary's voice returned, but it was weaker now, more uncertain. The clarity was gone, replaced by the wild, haunted look Taman had seen before.

"There is no god here," the missionary said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "No white god, no native god, no god that will fight this battle for you. The burden is yours to bear. The choice is yours to make. And no god will save you from it."

Taman felt the burden of those words pressing down. No god would fight this battle for him. The burden was his to bear. The choice was his to make. And there was no way to avoid it, no path that didn't lead through the burden, through the beating, through the lockup.

But he'd made his choice. He'd chosen to stand. He'd chosen to bear it. And that choice had weight. And he would bear that weight, whether it broke him or not.

He left the chapel less lost than before. He had his answer. The choice was his. He would stand, or he wouldn't. He would bear it, or he would break. But he would choose. And that choice had weight.

The scales were tipping. The burden was building. And Taman was alone, but he wasn't lost. He had his choice. He had his burden. And he would bear it.

Something had to give. Something had to break.

And he was starting to think it might be him. But he would choose to be part of it. He would choose to bear it. And that choice had weight.
