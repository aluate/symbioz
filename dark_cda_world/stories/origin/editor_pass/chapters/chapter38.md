# Chapter 38

Coyote offered Taman the last game that morning—a coin toss, simple, pure chance—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering choices instead of solutions.

"One last game," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "One last choice. One last payment. One last chance to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything, to make everything right."

Taman hesitated—he knew chance was balance, but his desperation blinded him, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real.

"I'll play," he said, his voice tight. "I'll choose. I'll pay. I'll do anything. I'll pay anything. Just give me a chance. Just give me a choice. Just give me a way to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything."

He called it, lost, and raged, blood choking his mouth, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent.

"No," he raged. "No, I lost. No, I chose wrong. No, I paid wrong. No, everything is wrong. No, everything is broken. No, everything is destroyed. No, everything is lost."

Coyote tilted his head, amused, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate.

"Balance always wins," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "You only speed it along. Choices matter. Payment matters. Burden matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. And now? Now you speed it along. Now you bring it closer. Now you make it happen."

Taman felt something break then—not outside, but inside—his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed.

He'd failed. He'd lost. He'd broken. He'd destroyed. And there was nothing he could do. Nothing he could choose. Nothing he could pay. He was done. He was finished. He was broken.

The hawk wheeled overhead then, vanishing into the smoke rising from the mountain, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance had broken, as if the scales had tipped, as if the something had come.

Back at Shadow, the ritual began that evening, Isaac nearly trembling with ecstasy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, his movements confident.

"The ritual begins," Isaac whispered. "The sacrifice starts. The burden will be shared. The scales will be tipped. The balance will be restored. And everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced."

Arpin raised his knife to Sela's throat that night, the blade sharp, the moment heavy, the choice made, the payment due.

This was it. This was the moment. This was when Sela would die, when her blood would feed the scales, when her burden would be removed, when her gift would be broken. This was when balance would be restored, when burden would be shared, when scales would be tipped.

The ground buckled then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
