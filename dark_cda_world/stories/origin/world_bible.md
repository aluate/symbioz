# 1. Cosmology & Metaphysics

## 1.1 **Balance / Weight**
- The universe of Dark CDA operates on a metaphysical principle called **Weight**.
- Every action, choice, promise, betrayal, lie, or mercy alters the Weight.
- Weight accumulates and distributes across: people, objects, animals, geography, and the mountain Olayah.
- Weight is not moral; it is **causal**. Heavy choices create imbalance that must be resolved.
- Imbalance manifests physically (tremors, ashfall, dead animals, warped reflections) and socially (crowd moods, compulsions, "unfair luck").

## 1.2 **Scales**
- The world has invisible metaphysical scales that maintain equilibrium.
- When scales tip too far, manifestations appear: earth groans, fissures, false weather, ash without fire.
- Scales respond to **choices**, not intentions.

## 1.3 **Names & True Weight**
- Names have metaphysical mass.
- Speaking someone's name with meaning (anger, love, betrayal, blessing) adds Weight.
- Naming something at a sacred site can bind it.

# 2. Magic System (Soft → Hard Hybrid)

Dark CDA magic is subtle, consequential, and grounded in emotional truth.

## 2.1 **Sela’s Gift (The Holding)**
- Sela can "hold" Weight temporarily so it doesn't break others.
- This manifests as calm, stillness, and the ability to soothe conflict.
- Her gift is finite; when overloaded, it rebounds into physical consequences.
- When she releases held Weight, it must go somewhere.

## 2.2 **The Boy’s Burden (Coin & Pouch)**
- The **coin** represents the destructive side of Weight: spending, cutting, severing.
- The **pouch** represents the restorative side: holding, mending, carrying.
- The boy holds both, creating internal imbalance.
- The coin amplifies charisma, persuasion, and coercion when rubbed or shown.
- The pouch amplifies empathy and reception.

## 2.3 **Coyote’s Magic (Choice Distortion)**
- Coyote embodies choice unbound by consequence.
- His magic includes: illusion of inevitability, nudging probability, "appearing" where logic fails.
- Coyote cannot force choices; he offers them.
- Every bargain with Coyote has a Weight cost.

## 2.4 **Graybreaker (The Enforcer)**
- A force/entity at the spring.
- Demands names and truth.
- Keeps cosmic scales from tilting too far.
- Appears when imbalance approaches catastrophe.
- Interacts with blood and spoken word.

## 2.5 **Hawk Magic (Witness / Messenger)**
- Hawks perceive Weight changes.
- They do not intervene.
- They mark turning points by circling or feather dropping.

## 2.6 **Mountain Olayah**
- The mountain is not a deity but a **pressure valve** of metaphysical Weight.
- When imbalance peaks, Olayah erupts.
- Earth tremors are early warning signs.

# 3. Objects of Power

## 3.1 **The Coin**
- Brass with an off-center starburst.
- Effect: amplifies intent, persuasion, charisma.
- Enables coercion when imbalanced.
- Carries the brother’s stain and the boy’s guilt.
- Reacts to Isaac’s usage later.

## 3.2 **The Pouch**
- Hand-stitched by Sela.
- Holds Weight without leaking.
- Tethers boy emotionally to sister.
- Symbol of patience and steadiness.
- When overloaded, distorts reflections, memories.

## 3.3 **The Ledger (Arpin’s Tool)**
- Ledgers in Fort Shadow function as binding instruments.
- Debts written in them take on metaphysical weight.
- They amplify Arpin’s control and Isaac’s coin.
