Act I — Foundations (Ch. 1–5)
Chapter 1 — Circles in the Pines
1. Morning breaks soft over Fort Shadow as Taman and Sela move into the timber beneath the mountain, following faint sign that seems to lead in a slow circle.
2. Taman feels most himself in the quiet—hawk overhead, pollen haze, a ground-hum he can’t name—while Sela’s calm steadies him without words.
3. Back at the palisade, Boone has already taken to Arpin’s ledgers, learning how numbers bind people tighter than rope.
4. Isaac keeps one hand in his pocket during a petty dispute, thumb working the hidden coin, and the matter resolves almost too quickly for Taman’s liking.
5. That night, Taman fingers his battered pouch in the dark and tells himself the circle is only the elk’s, not his.
Chapter 2 — Fort Shadow
1. The fort’s daily rhythm unfolds—smith’s anvil, carpenter’s saw, women at the well, children under Sela’s care—while Arpin smiles and measures out kindness like credit.
2. Isaac lingers at Arpin’s side, quiet hand in his pocket, as a flour dispute tilts the trader’s way with no raised voice or threat.
3. Boone explains the ledgers to Taman like they are a map to safety, and Taman hears only a route deeper into debt.
4. The missionary glides through the yard like a shade, muttering of crooked things and tremors as if the ground were a sermon nobody asked to hear.
5. A small shake rattles a chain and a bucket; Arpin calls it settling, but Sela and Taman share a look that says the earth is listening back.
Chapter 3 — Tracks and Ledgers
1. Taman spends the morning tracking sign that won’t commit—feathers, bent grass, scat cooling fast—while the hawk loops above like a coin that refuses to drop.
2. In the trading hall, Arpin forgives a woman’s debt with a fatherly pat, then folds her husband’s promise into the ledger with a smile that closes like a trap.
3. Isaac rubs his pocket idly while watching the exchange, and the couple walk away smiling as if they hadn’t been shackled.
4. Boone talks future—roads, routes, wagons—and Taman hears only narrower paths through a house that keeps adding locks.
5. That night, Taman dreams the mountain wears a single, unmoving cloud for a hat, and wakes to find the same cloud waiting.
Chapter 4 — The Spring That Remembers
1. Taman hikes to the high spring to think, and the surface gives back the trees and sky but stutters over his face like a skipped heartbeat.
2. The hawk perches close enough to be counted and tilts its head, as if the bird has an opinion about names.
3. Coyote appears as if he’d been there all morning—dust on his boots, grin like a dare—and offers a game with stakes Taman refuses to hear.
4. Coyote flips a coin once, catches it, and says balance prefers choices; down below, Isaac rubs the one in his pocket without knowing why.
5. Taman leaves with more questions than he brought and a sense the spring knows them by weight.
Chapter 5 — The First Stop
1. Taman quietly proposes to Sela that they slip east for a season—new trade, another fort, breathing room—but she warns that leaving doesn’t move the scales, it just moves them.
2. Boone won’t come—“not yet, not like this”—and promises to soften Arpin while learning more of the book.
3. The plan collapses at the gate when Arpin’s clerk invents a shortage that must be settled before any family departs, Isaac finally flashing his coin in public and charming the crowd into agreement.
4. A storm rolls out of a clear sky and sits on the mountain like judgment, trapping them in mud and rumor for three days.
5. When the sun returns, a faint smell of ash rides the wind though nothing has burned, and Taman understands they will not be leaving soon.
Act II — Arpin Ascendant (Ch. 6–10)
Chapter 6 — The Trader’s Squeeze

5. Sela whispers that weight is shifting, and Taman pretends he doesn’t hear.
Chapter 7 — First Blood
1. A blacksmith speaks openly against Arpin’s rule in the square, and for the first time the trader answers not with a smile but with a backhand and iron.

3. Taman rushes to help the smith, but Boone grabs his arm, warning that now is not the time.
4. The missionary mutters of crooked scales, and the hawk wheels overhead, silent witness.
5. At night, the earth trembles like a beast in sleep, rattling the water buckets against the wall.

Chapter 8 — Boone’s Silence
1. Taman presses Boone to stand with him and Sela against Arpin, but Boone insists that playing along is the only way to protect their family.
2. Desperate for guidance, Taman slips into the missionary’s crooked chapel, hoping for wisdom that Boone and his mother cannot give.
3. The missionary speaks in riddles, claiming names weigh more than sins and that even Christ stumbled under His Cross, but he offers no way forward.
4. Isaac passes by outside, hand deep in his pocket, and the missionary’s voice falters mid-verse as though unseen fingers pinched it shut.
Isaac rubs the coin in his pocket throughout the crowd’s unrest, muting outrage subtly. Only when pressure builds does he flash it, swaying voices.
5. Taman leaves the chapel more lost than before, realizing that no god here—white or native—will fight this battle for him.
Chapter 9 — The Charity Ledger
1. Arpin announces a “gift” to the community, distributing food and tools with a flourish while Isaac rubs his coin, then flashes it with calculated brilliance.

4. The hawk dives low over the square, scattering chickens and children, then vanishes into the sky without a sound.
5. That night, a fissure opens near the spring, warm mist rising from the crack as though the mountain had exhaled.
Chapter 10 — Ash on the Wind

5. That night, Taman dreams of a road leading out of the valley, and wakes determined to find it.
Chapter 12 — The False Guide Returns
1. Taman goes back to the missionary’s crooked chapel, desperate for direction after Boone’s silence and Arpin’s tightening grip.
2. The missionary raves about scales and sin, claiming “Christ’s cross was no lighter than your sister’s,” his words tumbling into madness.
3. Just as Taman turns to leave, the missionary blurts that he keeps a wagon bound for the east fort and knows men there who will listen.
4. Isaac walks past the chapel as the offer is made, hand buried in his pocket, and the missionary nearly chokes on his own verse before regaining his composure.
5. Taman seizes the chance, ignoring the riddles and clinging only to the road offered.
Chapter 13 — The Road East
1. Taman slips away at dawn with the missionary’s wagon, Sela’s blessing like a warmth pressed into his chest.

3. The missionary mutters scripture until it frays into nonsense, but the wheels roll smooth, as though the road itself were lighter.
4. Crossing a river, they meet his mother’s people, who scorn the missionary but speak softly with Taman, warning that weight cannot be outrun.
5. An elder tells him balance is not absence of weight but its sharing, and his sister’s burden will draw hunters if she is not protected.
Taman meets Mira, the daughter of a local trader tied to Fort Shadow. Sharp-eyed and kind, she quickly befriends him, curious about Sela’s gift and protective of her own people.
6. At their campfire, Taman tastes fresh roots and smoked fish, and feels how different the world is when the scales are level.

4. A council hears his plea, and though most dismiss him, one trader offers to open a quiet supply route west.
Mira warns Taman that Arpin’s grip will not weaken, even if the east fort feels balanced. She urges him to take his family east, planting a seed of what could be.
5. His mother’s tribe, present at the council, say only that they will not aid Arpin, nor will they raise hand against him—their balance is their own.
6. A sympathetic elder offers Taman a place to stay, promising that here his sister would not be hunted and his life could be whole.
7. Taman nearly breaks, tempted by the peace around him, but Boone, his mother, and Sela’s faces hold him like a tether.
