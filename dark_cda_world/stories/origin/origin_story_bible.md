- Characters (origin‑specific)
- Story‑level metaphysics
- Era‑specific locations, customs, politics
- Plot‑relevant artifacts and rules
- Timeline of the Origin era
- Themes and motifs unique to this book

# 1. Era Overview
The Origin era takes place generations before Fort Shadow, focusing on:
- The boy (Taman)
- Sela
- Their mother
- The early settlement
- The Trader’s arrival
- The first major imbalance of the valley
- The eruption and creation of the Mirror Lake
- The Split (Roland & Walter)

---

# 2. Magic & Metaphysics (Origin‑Specific)

These rules **augment** the universal metaphysics.  
They apply ONLY to this era and cast.

## 2.1 The Boy’s Dual Burden
- He holds both Coin and Pouch.
- This era defines how the **Keeper/Spender** duality originates.
- Emotional instability causes physical imbalance.

## 2.2 Sela’s Overload
- Her gift is still developing.
- Overloading causes: shaking hands, nosebleeds, memory loss, temporary silence.
- She unintentionally shields others from Weight surges.

## 2.3 Early Thin Places
Unique to this book:
- The timber circle
- The high spring where Graybreaker waits
- The split‑path clearing
- The lake that becomes the mirror

These thin places appear **before** the known geography of later eras.

## 2.4 Mother's Voice
- Her singing steadies the boy's pouch.
- When she is dying, her voice enters the Weight fabric and becomes a recurring echo.

## 2.5 The Ground-Hum
- A low vibration Taman feels more than hears.
- Indicates balance holding, things being as they should be.
- Like the earth itself breathing.
- Present in thin places and moments of equilibrium.

# 8. Append‑Only Lore (Origin)
Add new era‑specific lore here as it emerges.

## Chapter 1 Additions
- The pouch: Hand-stitched by Sela from scraps of leather and cloth. Has weight even when empty. Can hold Weight to steady Taman when choices pile up.
- Settlement structure: Palisade, central yard, smith, carpenter, well. Daily rhythm of work and community.
- Arpin's arrival: Six months before Chapter 1 events. Brought goods and ledger system that changed settlement dynamics.
- Isaac's coin: Hidden brass coin (possibly with off-center starburst) that amplifies persuasion. Works through touch/manipulation in pocket.
- Tracking circles: Animals (like elk) sometimes move in deliberate circles, which may indicate thin places or Weight accumulation.

## Chapter 2 Additions
- The Missionary: Gaunt outsider in dark clothes who moves through settlement like a shade. Mutters warnings about "crooked things," tremors, weight shifting, and the mountain waiting. Speaks of scales tipping, fire, and "the split." People dismiss him as mad, but he sees real patterns.
- Early tremors: Small ground shakes begin (Arpin dismisses as "settling"). Chain rattles at smith's forge. Ground-hum feels thinner, strained.
- Ledger philosophy: Boone sees ledgers as a "map to safety" - a tool for making things fair through order and accounting. Taman sees how numbers can be twisted and how ledgers bind people.
- Arpin's method: Measures out "kindness like credit" - generous gestures that create obligation. Uses ledger system to adjust allocations and create dependencies.

## Chapter 3 Additions
- Arpin's debt forgiveness: When Arpin "forgives" a debt, it doesn't disappear—it transforms into obligation, gratitude, and Weight. Creates chains of loyalty that bind people more tightly than numbers.
- Tracks that won't commit: Animals sometimes leave sign that shifts direction, refuses to make sense—may indicate Weight accumulation or thin places.
- Taman's dream: Mountain Olayah with unmoving cloud. Warning dream of weight building, something coming. Ground-hum gone in dream, replaced by heavy silence.
- Arpin's future plans: Maps out roads, routes, wagons, trading network. Promises stability and security through proper accounting. Taman sees it as both promise and potential cage.

## Chapter 4 Additions
- The High Spring: Thin place where water runs clear and cold. Reflections stutter, showing glimpses of something split/older. Spring "remembers" everything—every choice, every weight, every moment of imbalance. Knows Taman by weight.
- Coyote's appearance: Appears out of nowhere at the spring. Tall, lean, dark hair, eyes that shift color. Moves with animal grace. Offers choices, tests people. Every bargain has a cost.
- Coin flip mechanic: Coyote uses coin flip as excuse, but real choice is whether to engage/play. "Balance prefers choices, not chance." Taman calls heads, wins, but realizes he chose to engage with the moment.
- Hawk as witness: Perches close, watches, "counts" Taman. Marks turning points. Dark, intelligent eyes that measure and keep track.

## Chapter 5 Additions
- Taman trapped by ledger system: Arpin blocks his departure using "debts" and "obligations" Taman never consciously agreed to. Every received good/credit creates obligation. Ledger binds people even when they try to leave.
- Severe storm: Unprecedented weather event. Wind howls, rain sheets, lightning constant. Ground-hum gone, replaced by something heavy/dangerous. Storm feels like response to imbalance.
- Ash-scented wind: After storm passes, wind carries ash scent with no fire source. Smells of mountain, something deep/old/waiting. Warning sign that weight is building, scales tipping.
- Boone's choice: Refuses to leave, bound to ledgers and Arpin's promised future. Cannot see weight building because he doesn't want to. Ledgers tell him everything is fine.

## Chapter 6 Additions
- Names carry weight: Speaking names with meaning (anger, love, betrayal, calculated kindness) creates obligation and binds people. Arpin uses names strategically to create chains of loyalty.
- Weight follows you: Sela explains that running won't help—weight is part of what you carry, part of who you are. Tools (pouch/coin) are neutral; it's how you use them that matters.

## Chapter 7 Additions
- First open violence: Arpin strikes Hiram the blacksmith with backhand and iron rod when Hiram speaks against his rule. Blood hits the dust—first physical violence in the square.
- Isaac's coin revealed: For the first time, Isaac pulls the coin into view publicly. Brass with off-center starburst, catches light like fire. Dazzles crowd with promise of "order," turns them to cheer Hiram's punishment.
- Taman's inaction: Wants to help Hiram but Boone stops him, warning it's not the time. Taman stands by, watches, feels guilt and weight of doing nothing.
- Larger tremor: Earth trembles like "beast in sleep," stronger and longer than before. Rattles water buckets, shakes walls. Mountain stirring, restless.
- Hiram the blacksmith: Big man, broad-shouldered, steady. Speaks openly against Arpin, gets beaten and locked away. First person to openly resist.

## Chapter 8 Additions
- Boone's refusal: Insists playing along is the only way to protect family. Believes learning the system from within is the strategy. Taman sees it as surrender.
- Missionary's riddles: Speaks in cryptic wisdom—"names weigh more than sins," "even Christ stumbled under His Cross." Offers no clear path forward, only the weight of choice.
- Isaac's coin power: When Isaac passes near, missionary's voice falters mid-verse as if "unseen fingers pinched it shut." Coin bends truth, words, even verses. More powerful than realized.
- No god will fight: Taman realizes no god (white or native) will fight this battle for him. Weight is his to bear, choice is his to make. Alone in the weight.

## Chapter 9 Additions
- Arpin's "charity": Announces gift of food, tools, supplies. People cheer, sign ledger pages, create obligations. Gifts are chains dressed as ribbons.
- Isaac's calculated coin use: Flashes coin with "calculated brilliance" during gift distribution. Makes people feel grateful, makes ledger pages feel like gratitude instead of chains.
- Caleb the cooper: Argues for water storage, forward planning. Arpin mocks him, dismisses concerns. Silas drags him away—petty cruelty for speaking up.
- Hawk's dramatic dive: Dives low over square, scattering chickens and children, then vanishes. Marks moment, witnesses cruelty, sees chains being forged.
- Fissure near spring: Ground splits, three-foot-wide crack running toward mountain. Warm mist rises from crack—mountain "exhaling." Warning sign that weight is building, scales tipping.

## Chapter 10 Additions
- Sick animals: Wolves with foamed mouths, elk staggering and dropping mid-step. Animals dying mysteriously. Arpin dismisses as "natural," but his men quickly seize carcasses for disposal.
- Weight twists animals: Sela warns that weight can twist more than people—it can twist animals, the land itself. When scales tip too far, imbalance affects everything.
- Ash without fire: Thin layer of ash dusts roofs, ground, everything. No fire source, no smoke. Just ash falling from sky like "funeral shroud." Manifestation of weight/imbalance.
- Missionary taken seriously: For once, nobody laughs at missionary's warnings. People listen as he speaks of "crooked scales call crooked ends," ash as sign of what's coming.

## Chapter 11 Additions
- Larger tremor at dawn: Stronger than before, tilts buckets, knocks lantern from hook. Arpin dismisses as "nerves," but damage is real.
- Boone's ledger faith: Still believes ledgers will "one day free them," claims they're tools/maps. Taman sees every page as chain, every signature as cage.
- Sela's caution: Urges Taman not to confront Arpin "outright—not yet." Must wait for right moment, be smart, be careful.
- Hawk's feather: Hawk circles low, drops feather at Taman's feet—message/marking from witness. Taman feels chosen, marked.
- Dream of road: Taman dreams of clear path leading out of valley, away from weight. Wakes determined to find it—escape route calling.

## Chapter 12 Additions
- Missionary's wagon: The missionary keeps a wagon bound for the east fort and knows men there who will listen. Offers Taman passage, warning that the weight will follow.
- Isaac's coin silencing power: When Isaac passes near the chapel with coin in pocket, the missionary's voice cuts off mid-verse "as if unseen fingers pinched it shut." The coin bends truth, words, and even verses—even God's verses, as the missionary says.
- The missionary's warnings about the coin: Speaks of how "the coin sees, the coin hears, the coin knows" and warns Taman that if he goes east, the coin will know and the weight will follow.
- Taman's decision to go east: Seizes the chance to take the missionary's wagon, ignoring the riddles and clinging only to the road offered—the escape route from his dream made real.

## Chapter 13 Additions
- Taman leaves Fort Shadow: Slips away at dawn with missionary's wagon, Sela's blessing like warmth pressed into his chest. Road east is steadier, tremors fading behind him, birdsong without echo for first time in weeks.
- Encounter with mother's tribe: At river crossing, meets mother's people who scorn missionary but speak softly with Taman, warning that weight cannot be outrun—it's part of him now.
- Elder's wisdom: An elder explains that "balance is not absence of weight but its sharing" and warns that Sela's burden will draw hunters—men who want to use her gift, break it, turn it into a weapon.
- Mira introduced: Daughter of local trader tied to Fort Shadow. Sharp-eyed and kind, approximately 1-2 years older than Taman. Knows the way things are, offers to help Taman find men at east fort who understand balance.
- The difference of balanced scales: At tribal campfire, Taman tastes fresh roots and smoked fish, feels how different world is when scales are level, when weight is shared, when people work together.
- Temporary calm: Taman sleeps without dreams for first time in months, but knows in his gut this calm is not his—not yet. Weight follows, and he must eventually return to face what he left behind.

## Chapter 14 Additions
- The eastern fort: Larger than Fort Shadow, palisade marked with painted signs of welcome. Bustling with wagons and barter that feels fair and balanced. Humming with balance—a vibration of rightness, of equilibrium.
- Balanced life: Animals fat and healthy, children laughing without fear, air carries no ash. Everything speaks of balance, of weight shared fairly, of choices that don't break things.
- Council meeting: Most dismiss Taman's plea, but one trader offers to open quiet supply route west—a way to share weight, to balance scales, to give people hope. Won't break Arpin's grip but might loosen it.
- Mira's warning: Arpin's grip won't weaken from supply routes alone. Urges Taman to bring family east, to show them balance exists elsewhere, to plant the seed of what could be.
- Mother's tribe stance: Will not aid Arpin, nor raise hand against him. Their balance is their own. Will protect their people, share weight with those who share with them, but won't risk balance for another's war.
- Offer to stay: Sympathetic elder offers Taman a place to stay, promising his sister wouldn't be hunted, her gift would be respected, they could live whole. Taman nearly breaks but remembers Boone, mother, and Sela still at Fort Shadow.
- Bitter knowledge: Taman leaves with provisions, a map, and the bitter knowledge that he has tasted balance—and walked away from it. Carries the memory of balance, the seed of what could be, the hope of a different future.

## Chapter 15 Additions
- First supply wagons arrive: Wagons from east arrive quietly at dawn, loads small but honest—flour, salt, tools—without ledgers or debt. Taman feels he's bent scales in family's favor.
- Boone's cautious warning: Acknowledges change is good but warns Arpin will see it as theft, not trade, and will respond by tightening grip.
- Town whispers of hope: People whisper about new goods, daring to hope someone beyond Arpin's ledger still sees them, still cares, still remembers they exist.
- Sela's warning: Tells Taman he's done a good thing but reminds him "the scales never stop moving"—every choice matters, every weight shifts, and sooner or later it all comes due.
- Isaac senses shift: Rubs coin harder, mutters to Arpin that something is slipping, warns that people are talking about hope, daring to think there's a way out.
- Arpin's dangerous response: Arpin's gaze sharpens like a drawn blade, orders Isaac to find who's bringing goods, who's challenging his control, who's trying to tip scales without permission.
- Mother's pride and fear: Watches mother run fingers across provisions, testing their weight. Her silence both proud and fearful—proud of Taman's hope but afraid of Arpin's response.
- Larger tremor and missionary's laughter: Tremor strong enough to rattle crockery from shelf, missionary's laughter drifts across yard like broken glass, warning of things to come.
- Taman's realization: Stands in dark clutching pouch, knowing he's won a sliver of ground but painted a target across all their backs. The scales never stop moving, and sooner or later it all comes due.

## Chapter 16 Additions
- Taman urges family east: Returns from east fort urging family to come with him, telling of balance, laughter, and plenty at the eastern fort where scales are level and weight is shared.
- Boone refuses: Insists fort is their home, that Arpin's grip is strong but survivable if they're smart. Won't abandon home or people who can't leave. Believes survival is enough.
- Mother's shadowed silence: Listens in silence, eyes shadowed by memories of her tribe's warnings about weight, balance, and cost of choices. Wants to believe but is bound by choices and debts.
- Sela won't abandon Boone: Wants to believe Taman but won't leave without Boone's consent. Won't abandon family member even if it means staying. Family outweighs escape.
- Isaac's manipulation of Boone: Senses shift, rubs coin, leans on Boone whispering of duty and inheritance. Tells Boone fort is his home, his responsibility, that leaving is abandoning duty. Uses coin influence to keep Boone bound.
- Missionary's road wisdom: Wanders square babbling "all roads lead to scales," warning that every choice, every path loops back to weight and the beginning. Scales never stop moving.
- Tremor knocks apples: Tremor runs underfoot, knocks apples from vendor's cart. People laugh it off as clumsy luck, dismissing it, but Taman feels the weight and danger building.
- East slips away: Taman feels the east slipping away before it was ever his. Family won't leave, won't choose balance over survival, won't break bindings. Hope fades, east becomes impossible.

## Chapter 17 Additions
- Arpin unveils new terms: Binds every family in debt so deep no one could leave even if they wished. New terms for trade protect everyone but also bind everyone. Once you're in the ledger, you're protected but also obligated, also owned.
- Isaac's coin flashes in sun: Isaac pulls coin into sunlight, lets it flash once, brilliant and blinding. Coin gleams, mesmerizes crowd, turns suspicion into applause, fear into hope, resistance into acceptance.
- Taman tries to rally neighbors: Tries to remind neighbors of east fort, balance, escape. But their debts gag their courage—they're bound, obligated, can't leave while in debt. Debt never clears, just gets deeper.
- Sela's warning about defiance: Warns open defiance will only bring weight down harder, tighten chains, bind them deeper. Must be smart, careful, wait for right moment. Can't challenge directly when coin is so strong.
- Boone's silence: Caught between brothers, between leaving and staying. Chooses silence, chooses survival, chooses playing the game instead of breaking it. Mutters "numbers don't lie"—believes in using system instead of fighting it.
- Missionary's truth: Lingers in crowd reciting scripture out of order, whispering "the truth is in the weight, not the word." Ledgers lie, numbers lie, words lie, but weight never lies. Truth is heavy, hard, what you carry.
- Dream of east fort: Taman dreams of eastern fort's open sky, balance, weight shared. Wakes to walls of Fort Shadow pressing close, weight pressing down, chains tightening.
- Hawk's cry: Hawk's cry splits morning, sharp as ledger line. Fort stirs uneasy, people waking to sound, sensing weight building, scales shifting, something coming.

## Chapter 18 Additions
- Mother speaks against Arpin: Steps into trading square, names Arpin's rule cruelty in front of all. Speaks of ledgers as chains, debts as bindings, kindness as credit, credit as cage. Directly challenges his control.
- Arpin beats mother: Steps down from platform, strikes her hard, blows falling heavy until she staggers and falls in dirt, bloodied and broken. First open physical violence against Taman's family.
- Isaac's coin silences crowd: Rubs coin in pocket, crowd's anger ebbs into uneasy silence. Coin works its magic, power wrapping around them like chains, making resistance feel impossible, help feel foolish.
- Taman restrained by Sela: Lunges forward with rage but Sela's arms clamp around him, holding him back, warning that attacking would only get him killed, make things worse. Must be smart, wait for right moment.
- Boone paralyzed: Stands rooted, pale and silent, ledger tucked under arm like shield he cannot drop. Wants to help but legs won't move, voice won't work, will paralyzed by debt and obligation.
- Arpin's threat: Sneers down at mother, growls that next time he'll take more than blood—"a debt's a debt, and your flesh will pay." Debt must be paid in coin or flesh, that's how it works.
- Missionary's twisted scripture: Kneels beside mother's prone form, mutters broken scripture: "the wages of sin is weight." Every choice, every debt creates weight, and sooner or later it all comes due.
- Tremor splits crock: That night tremor splits crock of water in hut. Taman feels scales groaning beneath feet, mountain responding to violence and weight. Every weight shifts scales, brings eruption closer.
