# Chapter 1

Morning broke soft over Fort Shadow, the kind that made the world feel new and the night’s worries feel small. Taman moved through the timber with Sela at his side, their boots quiet on the needle-carpeted ground. The mountain Olayah loomed above them, its peak still wrapped in mist, and beneath their feet, faint sign led them in a slow, patient circle.

Taman read the ground like most men read words. An elk had passed here, maybe two hours gone. The tracks were clear enough—deep prints in the soft earth, broken twigs where it had pushed through underbrush. But something about the pattern nagged at him. The animal wasn’t moving toward water or away from danger. It was just circling, lazy and deliberate, as if marking time.

“You see it too,” Sela said, not a question.

Taman nodded without looking up. His sister had a way of knowing what he was thinking without him saying it. She walked a few paces behind him, letting him lead, but her presence steadied him. Always had. He felt most himself in the quiet—the hawk overhead making slow, patient loops, the pollen haze that hung in the air like gold dust, and that low ground-hum he couldn’t name but had learned to trust. It was the sound of things being as they should be, of balance holding.

The hawk circled counterclockwise, which was the way of things. Taman watched it for a moment, then returned to the tracks. The elk’s path curved back on itself, a wide arc that would eventually close. He’d seen animals do strange things before—sick ones, or ones that had been spooked—but this felt different. This felt like choice.

“We should head back,” Sela said. Her voice was calm, steady. She didn’t need to explain why. The sun was climbing, and there was work waiting at the palisade. But more than that, she could feel the weight of the morning pressing down, the way she always could when things were about to shift.

Taman straightened and looked at her. Sela was two years older, but she carried herself like someone who’d seen twice that. Her dark hair was braided back, practical, and her hands were steady at her sides. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. She could take the weight of a room, of a moment, of a choice, and keep it from spilling over. Taman had seen her do it a hundred times—calm a dispute, soothe a frightened child, steady a man who was about to do something he’d regret.

But gifts had costs. Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching. He’d seen the way she went quiet for days after holding too much, as if the words had been pressed out of her.

“All right,” he said, and they turned back toward the settlement.

The walk was quiet, companionable. Taman let his mind drift, following the hawk’s lazy circles overhead. The pollen caught the light, making everything feel hazy and dreamlike. That ground-hum was still there, a vibration he felt more than heard, like the earth itself was breathing.

By the time they reached the palisade, the settlement was fully awake. The sound of a smith’s hammer rang out, steady and rhythmic. Someone was sawing wood. Children’s voices carried from the yard where Sela would spend her afternoon. The place had a rhythm to it, a daily dance that Taman had learned to read as well as he read tracks.

Boone was waiting for them at the gate, a ledger book tucked under his arm. He was a year older than Taman, broad-shouldered and earnest, with a way of looking at the world that made everything seem like a problem waiting to be solved. He’d taken to Arpin’s ledgers like a fish to water, learning how numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

“Morning,” Boone said, falling into step beside them. “Arpin wants to see you, Taman. Something about the flour distribution.”

Taman felt a familiar tightness in his chest. Arpin was the trader who’d come to Fort Shadow six months ago, bringing goods and ideas that had changed everything. He was a tall man, well-dressed, with a smile that never quite reached his eyes. He kept ledgers for everything—who owed what, who had credit, who was in good standing. At first, it had seemed like a kindness, a way to help people through lean times. But Taman had watched how those numbers accumulated, how a small debt became a large one, how a favor became an obligation.

“What about the flour?” Taman asked.

Boone shrugged. “Some dispute. Isaac’s handling it, but Arpin wants you there.”

Isaac. Taman’s jaw tightened. Isaac was Arpin’s right hand, a quiet man who moved through the settlement like a shadow. He had a way of making problems disappear, of smoothing over conflicts before they could really start. Taman had seen him do it a dozen times, always with one hand in his pocket, thumb working something hidden there. A coin, maybe. Taman had never seen it, but he’d felt its weight in the air, the way it made people agree to things they wouldn’t normally agree to.

They found the scene in the central yard. A woman named Marta stood with her arms crossed, her face tight with anger. Her husband, a man named Jeb, stood beside her, looking uncomfortable. Arpin was there, calm and reasonable, and Isaac stood just behind him, one hand in his pocket.

“I’m telling you, we paid our share,” Marta said, her voice rising. “We gave you three sacks last month, same as everyone else.”

“And I’m not disputing that,” Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. “But the ledger shows a discrepancy. According to the records, you received four sacks, not three. The extra one needs to be accounted for.”

“That’s not right,” Jeb said, but his voice lacked conviction. He was looking at Isaac, and Isaac was just standing there, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman watched the exchange, feeling that tightness in his chest grow. He knew Marta. She was honest, hardworking. If she said she’d given three sacks, she’d given three sacks. But Arpin’s ledgers had a way of making truth feel flexible, of making people doubt what they knew.

Isaac shifted slightly, and Taman caught a glimpse of something in his pocket—a flash of brass, maybe, or the way the light caught on metal. The man’s thumb was moving in a slow, circular motion, and as Taman watched, he saw the tension drain out of Marta’s shoulders. Her arms uncrossed. Her face softened.

“I suppose,” she said slowly, “if the ledger says so, then maybe I’m mistaken. It was a busy month.”

Jeb looked relieved. “Right. Must have been a mistake on our part.”

Arpin smiled, the kind of smile that made Taman’s skin crawl. “No harm done. We’ll just adjust the records. Thank you for understanding.”

The matter resolved almost too quickly for Taman’s liking. One moment, Marta was angry and certain. The next, she was agreeing to something that didn’t make sense. Isaac’s hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that hidden coin, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it bent things toward agreement.

He wanted to say something, to step forward and point out that this wasn’t right. But what would he say? That he’d seen Isaac’s thumb moving? That he’d felt something in the air? That would sound like madness. And besides, Marta and Jeb were already walking away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted.

Arpin turned to Taman. “Ah, there you are. I wanted to make sure you saw how we handle disputes here. Everything gets recorded, everything gets balanced. It keeps things fair.”

Taman nodded, not trusting his voice. He could feel Sela beside him, steady and calm, taking some of the weight of the moment so it didn’t press down on him too hard. He was grateful for that.

“Come on,” Boone said, clapping Taman on the shoulder. “I’ll show you how the ledgers work. It’s really something, the way Arpin keeps track of everything. Makes the whole settlement run smoother.”

Taman let himself be led away, but his mind was still on Isaac, on that coin in his pocket, on the way things had shifted so quickly. He’d seen it before, this pattern. Small disputes resolved too easily. People agreeing to things they shouldn’t. The weight of choice being bent, twisted, made to serve someone else’s purpose.

That night, after the settlement had quieted, Taman sat in the dark of his small room and fingered his battered pouch. It was old, hand-stitched by Sela years ago, made from scraps of leather and cloth. It was empty now, but it had a weight to it anyway, a presence that he’d learned to trust. When things got too heavy, when the choices piled up and threatened to break him, he could put his hand on the pouch and feel it steady him, feel it hold some of the weight so he could breathe.

But tonight, the pouch felt different. Tighter, maybe. As if it was holding something he couldn’t see.

He thought about the elk tracks, about that slow circle in the timber. He thought about Isaac’s coin, about the way it made people agree. He thought about Arpin’s ledgers, about how numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

The circle is only the elk’s, he told himself. Not mine.

But even as he thought it, he felt the weight of the day pressing down, felt the way things were shifting, felt the ground-hum that meant balance was holding—but for how long?

Outside, the hawk was silent. The mountain Olayah loomed in the darkness, its peak hidden in cloud. And somewhere in the distance, Taman thought he heard the sound of scales shifting, of weight being redistributed, of choices accumulating.

He put his hand on the pouch and tried to steady himself. But the weight kept building, and he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that something was coming. Something that would change everything.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

# Chapter 2

The next morning, Fort Shadow woke to its usual rhythm. The smith’s anvil rang out first, a steady clang that cut through the dawn mist. Then came the carpenter’s saw, its teeth biting into wood with a patient, rhythmic whine. By the time the sun had cleared the palisade, the settlement was fully alive—women gathering at the well, their voices carrying across the yard, children already running under Sela’s watchful eye.

Taman stood at the edge of the central yard, watching it all unfold. There was a pattern to it, a dance he’d learned to read. The way people moved, the way they spoke, the way they avoided certain corners or lingered too long at others. It told a story, if you knew how to listen.

Arpin moved through it all like he owned the place, which in a way, he did. He’d arrived six months ago with wagons full of goods and a ledger system that had changed everything. Now he walked the yard with a smile that never quite reached his eyes, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. A word of encouragement to the smith. A pat on the shoulder for a woman struggling with a heavy bucket. A promise to look into someone’s concern about the next supply run.

It all looked generous. It all felt calculated.

Isaac followed a few paces behind, always there, always watching. He moved like a shadow, his presence felt more than seen. When Arpin stopped to talk, Isaac would linger at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman had learned to watch for it, that small motion, the way it made people nod and agree and walk away feeling like they’d been heard, even when nothing had really changed.

A dispute was brewing near the supply shed. Taman could hear the voices rising, could see the way people were gathering. He moved closer, not wanting to be noticed, but needing to see.

It was about flour again. A man named Tom stood with his arms crossed, his face tight. His wife, a woman named Ruth, stood beside him, looking worried.

“We were promised a full share,” Tom said, his voice carrying. “The ledger shows it. We’ve been working extra shifts, doing everything you asked. Where’s our flour?”

Arpin stood calm and reasonable, the ledger open in his hands. “I understand your frustration, Tom. But you have to understand—we’re all sharing resources here. The ledger shows your credit, yes, but it also shows that you received an advance last month. That needs to be balanced against your current allocation.”

“An advance?” Tom’s voice rose. “That was payment for the work we did on the palisade. You said it was payment, not a loan.”

“And it was,” Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. “But the way the system works, everything gets balanced. You received goods early, which means your current allocation is adjusted. It’s all here in the ledger. See?”

He held the book out, but Tom didn’t look at it. He was looking at Isaac, who stood just behind Arpin, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman felt that familiar tightness in his chest. He’d seen this before. The way Arpin’s words made sense on the surface, but didn’t add up underneath. The way Isaac’s presence made people doubt themselves, made them agree to things they shouldn’t.

“I suppose,” Tom said slowly, his shoulders slumping. “If that’s how the system works.”

Ruth looked relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. “Thank you, Arpin. We understand. We’ll make do.”

Arpin smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes. “That’s the spirit. We’re all in this together. The ledgers keep everything fair.”

Isaac’s hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that coin, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it bent things toward agreement. The dispute resolved, people drifted away, and Arpin moved on to the next person, the next kindness, the next measure of credit.

Taman turned away, not wanting to watch anymore. He found Boone at the edge of the yard, sitting on a crate with a ledger open in his lap.

“Morning,” Boone said, looking up. “You look troubled.”

Taman sat beside him. “Just watching.”

Boone nodded, as if that explained everything. He closed the ledger and set it aside. “You know, I used to think the world was chaos. That there was no way to make sense of it, no way to predict what would happen next. But these ledgers—they change everything. They show you the pattern. They show you how things connect.”

He picked up the book again, opening it to a page filled with columns and numbers. “See here? This is Tom and Ruth’s account. You can see their work credits, their advances, their allocations. Everything balanced, everything accounted for. It’s like a map, Taman. A map to safety. If you know where you stand, if you know what you owe and what’s owed to you, then you can plan. You can make decisions. You can protect yourself.”

Taman looked at the columns, at the neat rows of numbers. He understood what Boone was saying. There was a comfort in it, a sense of order. But he also saw how those numbers could be twisted, how a small adjustment here or there could change everything, how the ledger could make truth feel flexible.

“What if the numbers are wrong?” Taman asked.

Boone looked at him, his expression earnest. “That’s the beauty of it. The numbers can’t be wrong. They’re just numbers. They show what is. If there’s a discrepancy, it’s because something in the real world doesn’t match. The ledger helps you find that, helps you fix it. It’s a tool, Taman. A tool for making things fair.”

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the ledgers were just tools, that they made things fair. But he’d seen how Arpin used them, how Isaac’s coin made people agree to things they shouldn’t. He’d seen how the numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

Before he could say anything else, a figure moved through the yard, and the conversation died.

It was the missionary. Taman had seen him before, a gaunt man in dark clothes who moved like a shade through the settlement. He didn’t belong to Fort Shadow—he’d come from somewhere else, following some calling Taman didn’t understand. He moved through the yard now, muttering under his breath, his eyes fixed on something only he could see.

“Crooked things,” the missionary said, his voice carrying in the quiet. “Crooked things in crooked places. The earth knows. The earth remembers. Tremors coming. Weight shifting. Can’t you feel it? Can’t you see it?”

People moved away from him, giving him space. They’d learned to ignore him, to treat his mutterings as the ramblings of a madman. But Taman watched him, and he felt something cold settle in his chest.

The missionary stopped near the well, his head tilted back, looking at the sky. “The mountain watches. The mountain waits. When the scales tip too far, when the weight becomes too much, the mountain will answer. Tremors first. Then the fire. Then the split. Can’t you see it coming?”

His voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried. Taman felt the words settle in him, felt them resonate with something he already knew, something he’d been feeling but couldn’t name.

The missionary moved on, gliding through the yard like a shade, muttering about crooked things and tremors and weight that couldn’t be held. People ignored him, went back to their work, but Taman couldn’t shake the feeling that the man was seeing something real, something everyone else was choosing not to see.

A small shake rattled a chain hanging from the smith’s forge. It was a minor thing, barely noticeable, but Taman felt it in his bones. The ground-hum he’d learned to trust was still there, but it felt different now. Thinner. Strained.

Arpin noticed the shake too. He looked up from his conversation, his eyes scanning the yard. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, “Just settling. The ground settles sometimes. Nothing to worry about.”

People nodded, relieved. They wanted to believe him. They wanted to believe that everything was fine, that the ledgers would keep them safe, that the world would hold.

But Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down, felt the way things were shifting. He thought about the elk tracks, about that slow circle in the timber. He thought about Isaac’s coin, about the way it made people agree. He thought about the missionary’s words, about tremors and weight and the mountain waiting.

The ground-hum was still there, but it was changing. The balance was holding, but for how long?

Taman put his hand on his pouch, felt its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt different now. Tighter. As if it was holding something he couldn’t see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

The settlement went about its business, the rhythm of the day continuing. The smith’s anvil rang out. The carpenter’s saw whined. Women gathered at the well. Children ran under Sela’s watchful eye.

But Taman felt the weight of it all, felt the way things were shifting, felt the ground-hum that meant balance was holding—but just barely.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain Olayah loomed, its peak hidden in cloud, waiting.

# Chapter 3

Three days after the tremor, Taman was back in the timber, tracking sign that wouldn't commit. The ground was soft from recent rain, and the tracks were clear enough—deer, maybe, or something larger. But they kept shifting, changing direction, as if the animal couldn't decide where it wanted to go.

He crouched low, reading the ground like words. The prints were deep, well-defined, but they didn't tell a story. They moved east, then doubled back west. They circled a stand of pines, then veered north, then south again. It was as if the animal was lost, or searching for something it couldn't find.

The hawk looped overhead, making slow, patient circles. Taman watched it for a moment, then returned to the tracks. The bird had been following him all morning, its presence a constant reminder that something was watching, that something was waiting.

He followed the sign for another hour, moving through the timber with the quiet patience of a hunter. But the tracks kept shifting, kept refusing to commit to a direction. Finally, he stopped and straightened, looking up at the hawk.

"You see it too," he said, not expecting an answer.

The hawk circled once more, then drifted away, its wings catching the light. Taman watched it go, then turned back toward the settlement. The tracks weren't going to tell him anything useful. They were just marks on the ground, signs that refused to make sense.

By the time he reached the palisade, the sun was high overhead. The settlement was busy, the rhythm of the day in full swing. Taman moved through it, heading toward the central yard, where he knew he'd find Arpin.

He found the scene near the supply shed. A woman named Mary stood with her head bowed, her hands clasped in front of her. She was older, her face lined with worry, and Taman recognized her as one of the settlers who'd been struggling since Arpin's arrival.

Arpin stood before her, calm and reasonable, a ledger open in his hands. Isaac lingered at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"I understand your situation, Mary," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "I really do. Times are hard, and you've been doing your best. But the ledger shows a debt, and debts need to be settled. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair."

Mary nodded, her shoulders slumped. "I know. I just... I don't have the means right now. My husband's been sick, and we've been using our resources to care for him. I'll pay, I promise. Just give me a little more time."

Arpin looked at her for a long moment, his expression thoughtful. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and closed the ledger with a soft snap.

"You know what?" he said. "I'm going to forgive this debt. Consider it a gift. You've been through enough, and I believe in helping people when they need it most. The ledger will show it as settled. You don't owe anything."

Mary's face lit up with relief. "Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know how to repay you."

Arpin reached out and gave her a fatherly pat on the shoulder. "No repayment needed. Just keep doing your best. That's all I ask."

Isaac stood behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that coin. Taman watched the exchange, feeling that familiar tightness in his chest. It looked generous. It looked kind. But he'd seen this pattern before. The way Arpin forgave debts, the way he gave gifts, the way he made people feel grateful. It all created obligation. It all created Weight.

Mary walked away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. But Taman knew that the real burden was just beginning. Now she owed Arpin something that couldn't be measured in flour or coin. She owed him gratitude, loyalty, the weight of a favor that could never be repaid.

Isaac's hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that coin, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made the moment feel inevitable, the way it made Mary's gratitude feel like the only possible response.

Arpin turned and saw Taman watching. His smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "Ah, Taman. Did you see that? That's how we handle things here. We help each other. We forgive debts. We make sure everyone has what they need."

Taman nodded, not trusting his voice. He wanted to say something, to point out that the debt wasn't really forgiven, that it had just been transformed into something else, something heavier. But what would he say? That he'd felt the weight of it? That he'd seen how Isaac's coin made people grateful? That would sound like madness.

"Come on," Boone said, appearing at Taman's side. "I want to show you something."

Taman let himself be led away, but his mind was still on Mary, on the way Arpin had forgiven her debt, on the way Isaac's coin had made her gratitude feel inevitable.

Boone led him to a quiet corner of the yard, where he'd set up a small table with ledgers spread across it. He sat down and opened one of the books, his expression earnest.

"Look at this," he said, pointing to a page filled with columns and numbers. "This is the settlement's future. Arpin's been planning it, mapping it out. Roads, routes, wagons. A proper trading network that connects us to other settlements, to the east, to the coast. Can you imagine it? We'd have regular supply runs, established routes, a system that works."

Taman looked at the numbers, at the neat rows and columns. He saw routes mapped out, distances calculated, costs estimated. It all looked organized, planned, safe.

"Arpin says it's the future," Boone continued, his voice excited. "He says that with proper ledgers, with proper accounting, we can build something that lasts. We can create stability, security. No more worrying about lean times, no more wondering if we'll have enough. The numbers tell us. The ledgers show us the way."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the future could be mapped out in numbers, that roads and routes and wagons could create safety. But he also saw how those numbers could be used, how those routes could become chains, how that system could become a cage.

"What if people don't want to be part of it?" Taman asked.

Boone looked at him, his expression puzzled. "Why wouldn't they? It's safety. It's security. It's a future they can count on."

Taman didn't have an answer. He looked at the ledgers, at the numbers that promised safety, and he felt the weight of them pressing down. The future was being written in those books, and he wasn't sure he wanted to be part of it.

That night, Taman dreamed of the mountain.

In the dream, Olayah loomed above him, its peak hidden in cloud. But the cloud wasn't moving. It was still, unmoving, as if it had been painted there. The mountain wore it like a crown, and beneath it, the world felt wrong.

Taman stood at the base of the mountain, looking up, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by a silence that felt heavy, dangerous. The hawk was nowhere to be seen. The trees were still, their branches unmoving, as if they were holding their breath.

In the dream, he knew that something was coming. Something that would change everything. The mountain was waiting, the cloud was waiting, and the weight was building, accumulating, preparing to break.

He woke with a start, his heart racing, his hand already on his pouch. It felt tight, heavier than it should, as if it was holding something he couldn't see.

Outside, the settlement was quiet. The moon was high overhead, casting long shadows across the yard. The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream.

Taman sat up, his hand still on the pouch, and he felt the weight of the moment pressing down. The dream felt real, felt like a warning. The mountain was waiting. The cloud was waiting. And the weight was building.

He thought about the tracks that wouldn't commit, about the way the sign kept shifting, refusing to make sense. He thought about Arpin forgiving Mary's debt, about the way gratitude became obligation. He thought about Boone's future, about roads and routes and wagons, about a system that promised safety but felt like a cage.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, its peak hidden in unmoving cloud.

# Chapter 4

A week after the dream, Taman decided to hike to the high spring. It was a place he'd visited before, a thin place where the water ran clear and cold from a crack in the rock. But something had been calling him there, a pull he couldn't name, and he needed to see it for himself.

The path wound up the lower slopes of Olayah, following a game trail that had been worn smooth by generations of animals. Taman moved through it with the quiet patience of a tracker, reading the ground, watching the sky. The hawk was with him again, making slow circles overhead, and he felt its presence like a weight, like a witness.

By midday, he'd reached the spring. It was a small pool, maybe ten feet across, fed by water that trickled from a crack in the rock face above. The water was clear, almost too clear, and it reflected the sky and the trees with a clarity that felt unnatural.

Taman knelt at the edge of the pool, looking down at his reflection. For a moment, everything was normal. He saw his own face looking back at him, tired and worried, the face of a young man carrying too much weight.

Then the reflection stuttered.

It was a small thing, barely noticeable. His reflection flickered, like a candle in the wind, and for a heartbeat, he saw something else—something older, something split, something that wasn't quite him. Then it was back to normal, his own face looking up at him, but the moment had been enough.

The reflection knew something. The spring remembered something he didn't.

Taman straightened and stepped back from the pool. The hawk had stopped circling and was now perched on a branch nearby, its head tilted, watching him. It was close, closer than hawks usually got, and Taman felt the weight of its attention.

The bird's eyes were dark, intelligent, and they seemed to be counting him, measuring him, as if it was keeping track of something only it could see. Taman had heard stories about hawks, about how they witnessed things, about how they marked turning points. He'd never put much stock in them, but now, with the bird so close, he wondered.

"You're watching," he said, not expecting an answer.

The hawk just stared at him, its head tilted, and Taman felt the weight of that stare like a physical thing. Something was happening. Something was changing. The spring knew it. The hawk knew it. And he was starting to know it too.

He was about to turn away when a voice spoke from behind him.

"Interesting place, isn't it?"

Taman spun around, his hand going to the knife at his belt. A man stood there, leaning against a tree, and Taman had no idea how he'd gotten there. He hadn't heard footsteps, hadn't seen movement. The man had just appeared, as if he'd been there all along.

He was tall and lean, with dark hair and eyes that seemed to shift color in the light. He wore simple clothes—buckskin and cloth—but there was something about him that felt wrong, something that didn't quite fit. He moved with a fluid grace that was almost animal, and his smile was sharp, knowing.

"Coyote," Taman said, though he wasn't sure how he knew the name.

The man's smile widened. "You've heard of me. Good. That makes this easier."

Taman's hand stayed on his knife. "What do you want?"

Coyote pushed away from the tree and moved closer, his steps silent on the forest floor. "I want to talk. I want to offer you something. A choice, really. That's what I do—I offer choices."

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd heard stories about Coyote, about how he appeared at crossroads, about how he tested people, about how every bargain with him had a cost. But he'd never expected to meet him, never expected to be standing here, at the high spring, with Coyote watching him with those shifting eyes.

"What kind of choice?" Taman asked.

Coyote reached into his pocket and pulled out a coin. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and Taman recognized it immediately. It was the same kind of coin Isaac used, the same kind that amplified persuasion, that bent things toward agreement.

But this one felt different. This one felt heavier, more dangerous.

"Let's flip it," Coyote said, holding the coin up. "Heads, you walk away. Tails, you stay and we talk. Simple. Fair. A choice made by chance."

Taman looked at the coin, at the way it caught the light. He knew he shouldn't. He knew that every bargain with Coyote had a cost, that every choice had weight. But he also felt the pull of it, the way the moment seemed to demand a decision.

"Balance prefers choices," Coyote said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "The scales don't care about chance. They care about what you decide. So let's make it a choice. You call it. Heads or tails. You decide, and we'll see what happens."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. The spring was watching. The hawk was watching. Coyote was watching. And he had to choose.

"Heads," he said, not sure why.

Coyote flipped the coin. It spun in the air, catching the light, and for a moment, Taman thought he saw both sides at once—heads and tails, spinning together, refusing to commit. Then it landed in Coyote's palm, and the man closed his hand around it.

"Heads it is," Coyote said, opening his hand. The coin showed heads, clear as day.

Taman felt a strange mix of relief and disappointment. He'd called it, and he'd won. He could walk away. But part of him wanted to stay, wanted to hear what Coyote had to say, wanted to know what choice he was really being offered.

"You can go," Coyote said, his smile sharp. "You called it, and you won. The choice was yours, and you made it. That's how it works. But remember—balance prefers choices. Not chance. Not luck. Choices. And you just made one."

Taman looked at the spring, at his reflection that had stuttered. He looked at the hawk, still perched nearby, still watching. He looked at Coyote, with his shifting eyes and his knowing smile.

"What did I choose?" Taman asked.

Coyote's smile widened. "You chose to call it. You chose to play. You chose to engage with the moment instead of walking away. That's the choice that matters. The coin flip was just the excuse."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. He'd thought he was choosing heads or tails, but he'd really been choosing to engage, to play Coyote's game, to accept the moment. And now he was bound to it, in a way he didn't fully understand.

"The spring knows you," Coyote said, his voice soft. "It knows your weight. It knows what you carry. That's why your reflection stuttered. It's trying to show you something, but you're not ready to see it yet."

Taman looked at the spring, at the clear water that reflected everything with unnatural clarity. The spring knew him. It knew his weight. It knew what he carried—the pouch, the coin, the choices that were piling up, the weight that was building.

"What does it want to show me?" Taman asked.

Coyote's smile was sharp, knowing. "That's for you to find out. But remember—the spring remembers. It remembers everything. Every choice, every weight, every moment of imbalance. And it's waiting. Just like the mountain. Just like the scales. Waiting for you to tip them."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. The spring was waiting. The mountain was waiting. The scales were waiting. And he was the one who had to choose, the one who had to tip them.

He turned and walked away, leaving Coyote at the spring, leaving the hawk watching, leaving his reflection stuttering in the clear water. But he knew he'd be back. He knew this wasn't over. He'd made a choice, and choices had weight, and weight had consequences.

The spring knew him. It knew his weight. And it was waiting.

Two days after meeting Coyote, Taman found Boone at the edge of the settlement, looking over Arpin's ledgers. The sun was high overhead, and the day was warm, but Taman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.

"We need to leave," Taman said, not bothering with pleasantries.

Boone looked up from the ledger, his expression puzzled. "Leave? Leave where?"

"East," Taman said. "Away from here. Away from Arpin, away from the ledgers, away from all of this."

Boone closed the book and set it aside. "Taman, what are you talking about? We have a good thing here. Arpin's building something, something that will last. The ledgers show it. The numbers prove it. Why would we leave?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd been thinking about it since the spring, since meeting Coyote, since seeing his reflection stutter. Something was wrong. Something was building. The weight was accumulating, and he could feel it in his bones, in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited with its unmoving cloud.

"Because it's not safe," Taman said. "Because the weight is building. Because something's coming, and I don't want to be here when it arrives."

Boone shook his head. "You're worrying about nothing. The tremors? Arpin said it's just settling. The missionary? He's a madman. The ledgers? They're keeping us safe. Everything's accounted for, everything's balanced. That's how we stay safe."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the ledgers could keep them safe, that the numbers could protect them. But he'd seen how Arpin used them, how Isaac's coin bent things toward agreement, how gratitude became obligation, how debts became chains.

"It's not about the ledgers," Taman said. "It's about the weight. It's about the choices we're making, the way things are shifting. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest. "I see a future, Taman. I see roads and routes and wagons. I see a system that works, that keeps people safe, that gives them what they need. That's what I see. And I'm not going to walk away from that."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to leave. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in the ledgers, in the numbers, in the future Arpin was promising. He couldn't see the weight building, couldn't feel the way things were shifting, because he didn't want to. The ledgers told him everything was fine, and he believed them.

"All right," Taman said. "But I'm going. With or without you."

Boone's expression shifted, became worried. "Taman, you can't. Arpin won't let you. You're part of the system now. You have obligations, debts. You can't just walk away."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Obligations. Debts. The words felt heavy, felt like chains. He'd been careful, had tried to stay out of Arpin's system, but maybe it was too late. Maybe he was already bound, already part of the ledger, already weighed down by choices he hadn't known he was making.

"I have to try," Taman said.

He found Arpin in the central yard, talking with Isaac. The trader looked up as Taman approached, his smile widening, but it still didn't reach his eyes.

"Taman," Arpin said. "Good to see you. I was just talking about you. We have plans, big plans, and I think you'd be perfect for them. There's a route east that needs scouting, and you're the best tracker we have. What do you say?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Arpin was offering him a way out, but it wasn't really a way out. It was a way to bind him tighter, to make him part of the system, to create obligations he couldn't escape.

"I want to leave," Taman said. "I want to go east, on my own. No routes, no scouting, no obligations. Just me, leaving."

Arpin's smile didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. "I understand the desire for freedom, Taman. I really do. But you're part of this settlement now. You have responsibilities, obligations. The ledger shows it. You've received goods, credit, protection. That creates a debt, and debts need to be settled."

Taman felt the chill deepen. The ledger. The numbers. The way everything was accounted for, the way every kindness became a debt, the way every gift became a chain.

"I never asked for any of that," Taman said.

"But you received it," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "And receiving creates obligation. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair. You can't just take and leave. You have to balance the scales."

Isaac stood behind Arpin, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made Arpin's words feel inevitable, the way it made the moment feel like it had already been decided.

"I'm leaving," Taman said, his voice firm.

Arpin's smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Not until your debts are settled. The ledger is clear on that. But don't worry—we can work something out. There's always a way to balance the scales."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. He was trapped. The ledgers had bound him, the numbers had chained him, and he couldn't escape. Not without settling debts he'd never known he was making, not without balancing scales that had been tipped without his consent.

He turned and walked away, leaving Arpin and Isaac behind. The weight was building, and he could feel it in his bones, in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited.

That afternoon, the sky began to darken. Clouds rolled in from the west, heavy and gray, and the air grew thick with the promise of rain. By evening, the storm had arrived, and it was worse than any Taman had seen before.

The wind howled, tearing at the palisade, rattling the buildings. Rain fell in sheets, turning the ground to mud, and lightning split the sky, illuminating the settlement in flashes of white light. The thunder was constant, a low rumble that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Taman stood in the doorway of his small room, watching the storm rage. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by something else—something heavy, something dangerous. The weight was building, and the storm felt like a response, like the world was reacting to the imbalance.

The settlement hunkered down, waiting for the storm to pass. People moved through the rain, securing buildings, checking on neighbors, doing what they could to ride it out. But Taman felt the weight of it, felt the way things were shifting, felt the way the storm wasn't just weather—it was something more.

By morning, the storm had passed. The sun returned, weak and pale, and the settlement began to emerge from the wreckage. Buildings were damaged, the ground was mud, and people moved slowly, as if the storm had taken something from them.

But it was the wind that caught Taman's attention. When the sun returned, the wind carried a scent he'd never smelled before—ash. Not wood ash, not fire ash, but something else. Something that smelled of the mountain, of something deep and old and waiting.

Ash-scented wind, when there was no fire.

Taman stood in the central yard, breathing it in, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The storm had passed, but something else was coming. The ash-scented wind was a warning, a sign that the weight was building, that the scales were tipping, that something was about to break.

The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream. And the wind carried the scent of ash, and Taman knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that this was just the beginning.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 6

The ash-scented wind lasted three days. By the fourth morning, it had faded, but the memory of it lingered, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

Sela found him at the edge of the settlement, looking east toward the timber. She moved quietly, the way she always did, and he felt her presence before he heard her.

"You're thinking about leaving again," she said, not a question.

Taman didn't turn. "Arpin won't let me. The ledger says I have obligations."

Sela moved to stand beside him, her hands steady at her sides. "The ledger is just numbers, Taman. It can't hold you if you don't let it."

He looked at her then, saw the way she carried herself, the way she held the weight of the moment without letting it break her. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. But gifts had costs, and Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching.

"It's not just the ledger," Taman said. "It's the weight. The way things are building. Can't you feel it?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "I feel it. But running won't help. The weight follows you. It's part of you now. Part of what you carry."

Taman thought about the pouch at his belt, about the way it felt heavier lately, about the way it seemed to hold something he couldn't see. He thought about the coin, too, though he tried not to. He'd never used it, had never wanted to, but he carried it, and that was enough. Carrying it created weight, and weight had consequences.

"What if I'm the problem?" Taman asked. "What if the weight is building because of me, because of what I carry?"

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "The weight is building because of choices, Taman. Not because of what you carry, but because of what you do with it. The pouch and the coin are just tools. It's how you use them that matters."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that he could choose, that he could control the weight, that he could balance the scales. But he'd seen how Isaac used his coin, how it bent things toward agreement. He'd seen how Arpin used the ledgers, how numbers became chains. And he wondered if the tools themselves had weight, if carrying them was enough to tip the scales.

"Mother says names have weight," Taman said, changing the subject. "That speaking someone's name with meaning adds to the scales."

Sela nodded. "She's right. Names carry weight. Speaking them with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. That's why she's careful with them. That's why we all should be."

Taman thought about that. He thought about the way Arpin used names, the way he spoke them with calculated kindness, the way he made people feel seen, heard, valued. Every name he spoke created obligation, created weight, created chains that bound people to him.

"What if someone uses names wrong?" Taman asked. "What if they use them to bind people, to create weight that shouldn't exist?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Then the scales will balance. Eventually. The weight can't accumulate forever. Something has to give. Something has to break."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Something has to give. Something has to break. The words felt like a warning, like a promise. The weight was building, and eventually, it would break. The question was what would break first—the settlement, the mountain, or him.

They stood together in silence, watching the timber, watching the mountain, watching the way the world felt wrong, felt heavy, felt like it was waiting for something.

That afternoon, Taman found himself at the central yard, watching Arpin work. The trader moved through the settlement like he owned it, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. And every time he spoke someone's name, Taman felt the weight of it, felt the way it created obligation, felt the way it bound people to him.

"Tom," Arpin said, his voice warm, his smile wide. "How's the work going? I heard you've been putting in extra hours. That's the kind of dedication we need."

Tom's face lit up, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Arpin had spoken his name with calculated kindness, and now Tom felt seen, felt valued, felt obligated. The name carried weight, and that weight bound Tom to Arpin in a way that couldn't be measured in flour or coin.

"Ruth," Arpin said, turning to Tom's wife. "You're looking well. I hope your husband's been taking care of you. A good man like Tom deserves a good woman like you."

Ruth smiled, and Taman felt the weight of that, too. Two names, spoken with meaning, creating obligation, creating chains.

"Mary," Arpin said, moving on. "I was just thinking about you. How's your husband? Is he feeling better? If you need anything, anything at all, you just let me know."

Mary's face lit up with gratitude, and Taman felt the weight of it all pressing down. Names, spoken with calculated kindness, creating obligation, creating weight, creating a system that bound people tighter than rope.

Isaac followed behind Arpin, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. And Taman felt the weight of that, too, the way it made everything feel inevitable, the way it made the moment feel like it had already been decided.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And names were part of it, names spoken with meaning, names that created obligation, names that bound people in ways they didn't understand.

Taman put his hand on his pouch, felt its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and names carried weight, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 7

The tension in Fort Shadow had been building for days, a slow pressure that Taman felt in his bones. The ash-scented wind was gone, but the memory of it lingered, and people moved through the settlement with a wariness that hadn't been there before. The ground-hum felt thinner, strained, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

That morning, the blacksmith spoke.

His name was Hiram, and he was a big man, broad-shouldered and steady, with hands that could shape iron and a voice that carried. He'd been quiet since Arpin's arrival, working his forge, keeping his head down, doing what he could to survive. But something had changed. The weight was building, and Hiram had reached his limit.

He stood in the central yard, his hammer in his hand, and he spoke openly against Arpin's rule.

"This isn't right," Hiram said, his voice carrying across the yard. "This isn't how it's supposed to be. We're not slaves. We're not property. We're people, and we deserve better than this."

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of his voice, by the way he stood there, unafraid. Taman watched from the edge, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. This was it. This was the moment when someone finally spoke the truth, when someone finally stood up.

Arpin moved through the crowd, his smile gone, replaced by something cold and hard. Isaac followed behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"Hiram," Arpin said, his voice calm, almost reasonable. "I understand your frustration. But we have a system here. A system that works. A system that keeps everyone safe. You can't just stand there and say it's wrong without offering something better."

"It's wrong," Hiram said, his voice firm. "The ledgers are chains. The debts are cages. You're not helping us—you're binding us. And I won't stand for it anymore."

Arpin's expression shifted, and for the first time, Taman saw something dangerous in his eyes. The trader stepped forward, and before anyone could react, he struck Hiram hard across the face with the back of his hand.

The sound was sharp, like a whip crack, and Hiram staggered back, blood already welling from his lip. But Arpin wasn't done. He grabbed a piece of iron from the smith's own forge—a rod, still warm from the fire—and struck Hiram again, this time across the shoulder.

The crowd gasped as blood hit the dust, dark and sudden. Hiram dropped to one knee, his hammer falling from his hand, and the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Isaac stepped forward then, and for the first time, he pulled the coin into view. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and it caught the light like fire. He held it up, turning it slowly, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Order," Isaac said, his voice carrying across the yard. "That's what we need. Order and balance. Arpin gives us that. He keeps us safe. He keeps us fed. And this man"—he pointed at Hiram, still kneeling in the dust—"this man would take that away. He would bring chaos. He would bring suffering. Is that what you want?"

The crowd was silent, watching the coin, feeling its weight. Then someone cheered—a single voice, uncertain at first, then growing. Others joined in, and soon the whole yard was filled with voices, cheering Hiram's punishment, cheering Arpin's rule, cheering the order that Isaac promised.

Taman felt sick. He wanted to rush forward, to help Hiram, to stand against this, to do something. But before he could move, Boone grabbed his arm, his grip tight.

"Don't," Boone said, his voice low, urgent. "Not now. Not like this. You'll only make it worse."

Taman looked at him, saw the fear in his eyes, saw the way he held the ledger under his arm like a shield. "He's hurt," Taman said. "We have to help him."

"We can't," Boone said. "Not now. The crowd is with Arpin. Isaac's coin has them. If we step in now, we'll be next. We have to wait. We have to be smart."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to pull away, wanted to do something. But he saw the way the crowd was watching, the way Isaac's coin had them, the way they cheered Hiram's punishment. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that Boone was right. Stepping in now would only make things worse.

The missionary moved through the crowd, muttering under his breath. "Crooked scales," he said, his voice carrying in the silence between cheers. "Crooked scales call crooked ends. The weight is shifting. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

But no one was listening. The crowd was with Arpin, with Isaac, with the coin that promised order. The missionary's words were just noise, just the ramblings of a madman.

The hawk wheeled overhead, making slow, patient circles. Taman watched it, felt the weight of its attention, felt the way it marked this moment, this turning point. The bird was a witness, silent and watchful, and it saw everything—the blood in the dust, the coin in Isaac's hand, the crowd cheering, the scales tipping.

Arpin stepped forward, his expression cold. "Take him away," he said, pointing at Hiram. "Lock him up. We'll deal with him later."

Men moved forward, grabbing Hiram, dragging him away. The blacksmith didn't resist, didn't fight. He just looked at Taman, his eyes meeting Taman's for a moment, and in that look, Taman saw something—disappointment, maybe, or understanding. Then he was gone, dragged away, and the crowd began to disperse.

Taman stood there, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd done nothing. He'd stood by and watched. He'd let Boone stop him, let fear stop him, let the weight of Isaac's coin stop him. And now Hiram was gone, locked away, and the scales had tipped further, and there was nothing he could do about it.

That night, the earth trembled.

It wasn't a small shake, like before. This was something bigger, something deeper. The ground moved beneath them, and Taman felt it in his bones, felt it in the way the walls shook, felt it in the way the water buckets rattled against the wall.

It was like a beast in sleep, stirring, restless. The tremor lasted longer than any before, and when it finally stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Taman sat in the dark, his hand on his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

He thought about Hiram, about the blood in the dust, about the way Isaac's coin had turned the crowd. He thought about Boone, about the way he'd stopped him, about the fear in his eyes. He thought about the missionary, about his mutterings of crooked scales, about the way no one was listening.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And Taman had done nothing to stop it.

The earth trembled again, a smaller shake this time, but enough to rattle the buckets, enough to remind him that the mountain was waiting, that something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 8

The next morning, Taman found Boone at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers. The sun was high overhead, but the day felt heavy, wrong, and Taman could still see Hiram's blood in the dust, could still hear the crowd cheering, could still feel the weight of his own inaction.

"We have to do something," Taman said, not bothering with pleasantries. "We can't just stand by and watch. Hiram spoke the truth, and Arpin beat him for it. If we don't stand against this, we're complicit."

Boone looked up from the ledger, his expression troubled. "I know, Taman. I know it's wrong. But what can we do? Arpin has the crowd. Isaac's coin has them. If we stand against him now, we'll be next. We'll be the ones beaten, the ones locked away."

"We have to try," Taman said. "You, me, Sela—we stand together. We speak the truth. We show people that there's another way."

Boone closed the ledger and set it aside. "And what happens when Arpin beats us? When Isaac's coin turns the crowd against us? When we're locked away, just like Hiram? Who protects our family then? Who keeps them safe?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Boone was right, in a way. Standing against Arpin now would be dangerous. It would put them at risk, put their family at risk. But doing nothing was also dangerous. The weight was building, the scales were tipping, and if they didn't do something, if they didn't stand against it, then they were part of the problem.

"Playing along isn't protecting anyone," Taman said. "It's just making it worse. Every day we stay silent, every day we let Arpin rule, the weight builds. The scales tip further. Eventually, something has to break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest, troubled. "I know you're right, Taman. I know the weight is building. I can feel it too. But I also know that if we stand against Arpin now, we'll lose. We'll be beaten, locked away, and nothing will change. But if we play along, if we learn the system, if we understand how it works, then maybe we can find a way to change it from within. Maybe we can protect our family and still make a difference."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that playing along was a strategy, that learning the system was a way to change it. But he'd seen how Arpin worked, how Isaac's coin bent things, how the ledgers bound people. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that playing along wasn't a strategy—it was surrender.

"Boone," Taman said, his voice firm. "Stand with me. Stand with Sela. We can do this together."

Boone shook his head. "I can't, Taman. Not yet. Not like this. I need to protect our family. I need to keep them safe. And right now, that means playing along. That means learning the system. That means waiting for the right moment."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to stand with him. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in fear, in the need to protect, in the belief that playing along was the only way. And maybe he was right. Maybe standing against Arpin now would only make things worse. But Taman couldn't shake the feeling that doing nothing was also wrong, that silence was complicity, that the weight was building and something had to give.

He left Boone there, standing at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers, and he felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He needed guidance. He needed wisdom. He needed someone to tell him what to do, how to fight this, how to stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away.

Desperate, he slipped into the missionary's crooked chapel.

It was a small building, tucked away at the edge of the settlement, built from scraps and salvaged wood. The walls were crooked, the roof sagged, and the whole thing looked like it might collapse at any moment. But it was a place of refuge, a place where people came to seek guidance, to find answers, to understand the weight of the world.

The missionary was inside, muttering to himself, his Bible open in his hands. He looked up as Taman entered, his eyes wild, his expression troubled.

"Ah," the missionary said, his voice carrying in the small space. "Another seeker. Another soul looking for answers. But answers are heavy, boy. They carry weight. Are you ready to bear it?"

Taman sat on a rough bench, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. "I need to know what to do," he said. "Arpin is wrong. His rule is wrong. But if I stand against him, I'll be beaten, locked away, just like Hiram. And if I don't, I'm complicit. I'm part of the problem. What do I do?"

The missionary looked at him for a long moment, his expression shifting, becoming thoughtful. "Names weigh more than sins," he said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "That's what you need to understand. Names carry weight. Speaking them with meaning, with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. And even Christ stumbled under His Cross. Even He bore the weight. But He bore it. He didn't run from it. He didn't hide from it. He faced it, and He bore it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. Names weigh more than sins. Even Christ stumbled under His Cross. The words felt like riddles, like puzzles he couldn't solve. What did they mean? How did they help? What was he supposed to do?

"But how?" Taman asked. "How do I face it? How do I bear it? How do I stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away?"

The missionary shook his head. "There is no way, boy. There is no path that avoids the weight. You stand, or you don't. You bear it, or you break. That's the choice. That's always been the choice."

Taman felt frustration building. He'd come here for answers, for guidance, for a way forward. But the missionary was giving him riddles, giving him questions instead of answers, giving him weight instead of relief.

"Then what's the point?" Taman asked. "If there's no way to avoid it, if standing means getting beaten, if bearing it means breaking, then what's the point of trying?"

The missionary looked at him, his expression shifting, becoming almost gentle. "The point is the choice, boy. The point is that you choose. You choose to stand, or you choose to run. You choose to bear it, or you choose to break. The weight doesn't care. The scales don't care. But you care. And that's what matters. That's what makes the difference."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand better answers, wanted to find a way forward. But before he could speak, Isaac passed by outside, his hand deep in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

The missionary's voice faltered mid-verse, as though unseen fingers had pinched it shut. He looked toward the door, his expression shifting, becoming troubled, and Taman felt the weight of Isaac's presence, the way it bent things, the way it silenced voices.

"The coin," the missionary whispered, his voice barely audible. "The coin bends things. It makes truth feel flexible. It makes choices feel inevitable. And when it's near, even the words falter. Even the verses fail."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Isaac's coin was powerful, more powerful than he'd realized. It didn't just bend people—it bent truth, it bent words, it bent the very fabric of the moment. And when it was near, even the missionary's voice faltered, even his verses failed.

Isaac moved on, his hand still in his pocket, thumb still working that coin, and the missionary's voice returned, but it was weaker now, more uncertain.

"There is no god here," the missionary said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "No white god, no native god, no god that will fight this battle for you. The weight is yours to bear. The choice is yours to make. And no god will save you from it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. No god would fight this battle for him. The weight was his to bear. The choice was his to make. And there was no way to avoid it, no path that didn't lead through the weight, through the beating, through the lockup.

He left the chapel more lost than before, realizing that no god here—white or native—would fight this battle for him. The weight was his. The choice was his. And he had to make it, had to bear it, had to face it, or he had to run, had to hide, had to break.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And Taman was alone, lost, with no god to save him, no path that avoided the weight.

Something had to give. Something had to break.

And he was starting to think it might be him.

# Chapter 9

Three days after Hiram's beating, Arpin called the settlement together in the central yard. The sun was high overhead, and the day was warm, but Taman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. Something was coming. He could feel it in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited, in the way Arpin moved through the crowd with that smile that never reached his eyes.

"Friends," Arpin said, his voice carrying across the yard. "Neighbors. Family. I've called you here today because I have a gift for you. A gift to show you that I care, that I'm here for you, that we're all in this together."

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of his voice, by the promise of a gift. Taman watched from the edge, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd seen this before. Arpin's gifts were never free. They always came with strings, with obligations, with weight.

Isaac stood at Arpin's side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman watched him, felt the weight of the coin in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Food," Arpin said, gesturing to wagons that had been brought into the yard. "Tools. Supplies. Everything you need to get through the coming months. I'm giving it to you freely, with no strings attached. Because that's what neighbors do. That's what family does. We help each other."

The crowd cheered, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. Arpin was giving them food, tools, supplies, and they were grateful. They were cheering. They were signing ledger pages, putting their names to paper, creating obligations they didn't understand.

Isaac stepped forward then, and for the first time since Hiram's beating, he pulled the coin into view. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and it caught the light like fire. He held it up, turning it slowly, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Order," Isaac said, his voice carrying across the yard. "That's what this gift represents. Order and balance. Arpin gives you what you need, and you give him your trust, your loyalty, your names. That's how balance works. That's how we stay safe."

The coin flashed in the sunlight, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. Isaac was using it now, using it to bend the moment, to make the gift feel like a blessing, to make the ledger pages feel like gratitude instead of chains.

The people cheered louder, mothers weeping in gratitude, children running to the wagons, and Taman watched as they signed the ledger pages, as they put their names to paper, as they created obligations they didn't understand. Every signature was a chain. Every name was weight. And they were giving it freely, gratefully, because Isaac's coin made them feel like it was the right thing to do.

Taman felt rage building. He wanted to step forward, to speak the truth, to tell them that the gifts were chains, that the ledger pages were cages, that they were binding themselves to Arpin in ways they didn't understand. He wanted to tell them about Sela, about her gift, about the way she held weight, about the way Arpin would use her if he knew.

But he stopped himself. Speaking Sela's secret would only make things worse. It would put her in danger, put their family in danger, and it wouldn't change anything. The crowd was with Arpin, with Isaac, with the coin that promised order. They wouldn't listen. They wouldn't believe. They would only see him as a troublemaker, as someone who spoke against the gift, against the order, against the balance.

A man named Caleb stepped forward then, his expression troubled. He was a cooper, a maker of barrels, and he'd been quiet since Arpin's arrival, working his trade, keeping his head down. But something had changed. The weight was building, and Caleb had reached his limit.

"Water storage," Caleb said, his voice carrying across the yard. "We need water storage. The well is running low, and if we don't prepare, we'll be in trouble. I've been asking for months, and nothing's been done. These gifts are fine, but we need water. We need to think ahead."

Arpin's smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "Caleb," he said, his tone patient, almost condescending. "I understand your concern. But we have plenty of water. The well is fine. And these gifts"—he gestured to the wagons—"these gifts are what we need right now. Food. Tools. Supplies. That's what matters. Water storage can wait."

Caleb shook his head. "It can't wait. If we don't prepare now, we'll be in trouble later. I'm not asking for much. Just some barrels, some planning, some thought for the future."

Arpin's expression shifted, and Taman saw something dangerous in his eyes. "The future is my concern, Caleb. Not yours. You worry about your barrels. I'll worry about the settlement. That's how it works. That's how we stay organized."

A man named Silas stepped forward then, a rope in his hand. He was one of Arpin's men, one of the ones who did the dirty work, and he moved with a cruelty that made Taman's skin crawl. He grabbed Caleb's arm, dragging him away, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down.

"Let him go," Taman said, stepping forward. "He's just asking a question. He's just trying to help."

Silas looked at him, his expression cold. "Stay out of it, boy. This doesn't concern you."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to step in, wanted to do something. But before he could move, the hawk dove low over the square, its wings beating the air, scattering chickens and children, and for a moment, everything stopped.

The bird was huge, its wingspan wider than a man's reach, and it moved with a grace that was almost unnatural. It dove low, so low that Taman could see its eyes, dark and intelligent, and then it pulled up, vanishing into the sky without a sound.

The moment passed, and the crowd returned to the wagons, to the gifts, to the ledger pages. But Taman felt the weight of the hawk's presence, the way it had marked this moment, the way it had witnessed the cruelty, the way it had seen the chains being forged.

Caleb was gone, dragged away by Silas, and the crowd had already forgotten him. They were signing ledger pages, taking gifts, creating obligations, and they didn't see the chains, didn't feel the weight, didn't understand what they were doing.

Taman watched it all, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. The gifts were chains. The ledger pages were cages. And the people were binding themselves to Arpin, creating obligations they didn't understand, because Isaac's coin made them feel like it was the right thing to do.

That night, a fissure opened near the spring.

Taman heard about it the next morning, from people who'd been up early, checking the water, making sure everything was all right. They said the ground had split, a crack maybe three feet wide, running from the spring toward the mountain. And from the crack, warm mist rose, like the mountain had exhaled, like something deep and old was breathing.

Taman went to see it for himself, hiking up to the spring, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. The fissure was there, just as they'd said, a crack in the earth that shouldn't exist. And from it, warm mist rose, carrying a scent he'd never smelled before—something deep, something old, something waiting.

The mountain was stirring. The weight was building. And the fissure was a warning, a sign that something was coming, that the scales were tipping, that something had to give.

Taman stood at the edge of the fissure, looking down into the darkness, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The mountain was breathing. The ground was splitting. And the gifts in the yard were chains, and the ledger pages were cages, and the people were binding themselves to Arpin, creating obligations they didn't understand.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

The rumors started two days after the fissure opened. Someone had found a wolf on the outskirts, dead, its mouth foaming, its eyes clouded. Then another. Then an elk, staggering and dropping mid-step, its legs giving out beneath it. The animals were sick, dying, and no one knew why.

Taman heard about it from Boone, who'd been at the edge of the settlement, checking the perimeter, making sure everything was secure. His expression was troubled, his voice low, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down.

"They're just sick," Boone said. "It happens. Animals get sick. They die. It's natural. Nothing to worry about."

But Taman had seen the animals. He'd seen the way they moved, the way they staggered, the way they dropped. It wasn't natural. It wasn't normal. Something was wrong, something that went deeper than sickness, something that felt like weight, like imbalance, like the scales tipping too far.

Arpin called the settlement together that afternoon, his expression calm, reasonable. "I've heard the rumors," he said, his voice carrying across the yard. "I've heard about the animals. And I want to put your minds at ease. This is nonsense. Animals get sick. They die. It's natural. Nothing to worry about."

But even as he spoke, his men were moving, seizing the carcasses, dragging them away for disposal. They moved quickly, efficiently, as if they'd done this before, as if they knew what to do. And Isaac stood at Arpin's side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"The animals are being taken care of," Arpin said. "The carcasses are being disposed of. There's nothing to worry about. Everything is under control."

The crowd nodded, relieved, and Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. They believed Arpin. They trusted him. They didn't see the way his men moved, the way they seized the carcasses, the way Isaac's coin made everything feel inevitable.

That evening, Taman found Sela at the edge of the settlement, looking out toward the timber, her expression troubled.

"You've heard about the animals," she said, not a question.

Taman nodded. "Boone says it's natural. Arpin says it's nothing to worry about."

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "The weight can twist more than people, Taman. It can twist animals. It can twist the land itself. When the scales tip too far, when the imbalance becomes too great, it doesn't just affect us. It affects everything."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. The weight could twist animals. It could twist the land. And the animals were sick, dying, their mouths foaming, their legs giving out. It wasn't natural. It wasn't normal. It was weight, imbalance, the scales tipping too far.

"What do we do?" Taman asked.

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the weight from breaking. But eventually, something has to give. Something has to break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. Something has to give. Something has to break. And when it does, they'll all be caught in it. The animals were just the beginning. The weight was building, the scales were tipping, and something was coming.

That night, Taman dreamed of the animals. He saw them staggering, dropping, their mouths foaming, their eyes clouded. He saw the wolves, the elk, the way they moved, the way they died. And he felt the weight of it, the way it twisted things, the way it made everything wrong.

He woke before dawn, his heart racing, his hand on his pouch. It felt heavier now, tighter, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

He stepped outside, breathing the morning air, and that's when he saw it.

Ash.

A thin layer of it, dusting the roofs, the ground, everything. It was fine, gray, like the ash from a fire, but there was no fire. No smoke. No source. Just ash, falling from the sky, dusting everything like a funeral shroud.

Taman stood there, breathing it in, feeling the weight of it pressing down. Ash without fire. Ash from nowhere. It was a sign, a warning, a manifestation of the weight, of the imbalance, of the scales tipping too far.

The settlement began to wake, people stepping outside, seeing the ash, feeling it on their skin, in their hair, on their clothes. They moved slowly, warily, as if they knew something was wrong, as if they felt the weight of it, the way it made everything feel heavy, dangerous.

Arpin appeared in the central yard, his expression calm, reasonable. "It's just ash," he said, his voice carrying. "From the mountain, probably. Or from a fire somewhere. Nothing to worry about. It'll clear. Everything will be fine."

But the people weren't listening. They were looking at the ash, feeling it on their skin, and they knew, with a certainty that made their chests tight, that something was wrong. Something was coming. Something that would change everything.

The missionary appeared then, moving through the crowd, his expression wild, his voice carrying. "Crooked scales call crooked ends," he said, his words sharp, clear. "The weight is shifting. The imbalance is growing. And the ash is a sign, a warning, a manifestation of what's coming. Can't you see it? Can't you feel it?"

For once, nobody laughed. Nobody dismissed him. They listened, their expressions troubled, their eyes fixed on the ash, on the way it dusted everything, on the way it made the world feel wrong.

"The mountain is stirring," the missionary said. "The scales are tipping. And when they tip too far, when the weight becomes too much, the mountain will answer. The ash is just the beginning. There's more coming. More weight. More imbalance. More breaking."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. The ash was a sign. The animals were a sign. The fissure was a sign. Everything was a sign, a warning, a manifestation of the weight, of the imbalance, of the scales tipping too far.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 11

The tremor came at dawn, rattling the fort like a beast shaking off sleep. Taman woke to the sound of things falling, of buckets tilting, of a lantern crashing from its hook. The ground moved beneath him, and he felt it in his bones, in the way the walls shook, in the way the whole settlement seemed to groan.

It lasted longer than any tremor before, and when it finally stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous. Taman stepped outside, breathing the morning air, and he saw the damage—buckets overturned, tools scattered, the lantern broken on the ground. Small things, but they felt like signs, like warnings, like the weight building, the scales tipping.

Arpin appeared in the central yard, his expression calm, reasonable. "It's just settling," he said, his voice carrying. "The ground settles sometimes. It's natural. Nothing to worry about. Everyone's just nervous, that's all. The tremors are making people jumpy."

But Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. This wasn't settling. This wasn't natural. This was something deeper, something older, something that went beyond the ground, beyond the settlement, beyond anything Arpin could control.

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of Arpin's voice, by the promise of reassurance. They listened, nodding, relieved, and Taman felt the weight of it all pressing down. They believed Arpin. They trusted him. They didn't see the way the ground was shifting, the way the weight was building, the way the scales were tipping.

Boone found Taman at the edge of the yard, his expression troubled. "I know it's hard," he said, his voice low. "I know the weight is building. But we have to be patient. The ledgers will one day free us. They'll show us the way. They'll give us the tools we need to change things. We just have to wait. We just have to be smart."

Taman looked at him, saw the way he held the ledger under his arm like a shield, saw the way he believed in the numbers, in the system, in the promise of freedom through accounting. And he wanted to believe it too. He wanted to believe that the ledgers could free them, that patience could change things, that being smart could protect them.

But he'd seen how Arpin used the ledgers, how Isaac's coin bent things, how every page was a chain, every signature a cage. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that the ledgers wouldn't free them. They would only bind them tighter, only create more weight, only tip the scales further.

"Every page is a chain, Boone," Taman said. "Every signature is a cage. The ledgers won't free us. They'll only bind us tighter."

Boone shook his head. "You're wrong, Taman. The ledgers are tools. They're maps. They show us where we stand, what we owe, what's owed to us. And if we understand them, if we learn to use them, then we can change things. We can make them work for us instead of against us."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to explain, wanted to make Boone see. But he knew it wouldn't help. Boone believed in the ledgers, believed in the system, believed in the promise of freedom through accounting. And nothing Taman could say would change that.

He found Sela later that morning, at the edge of the settlement, looking out toward the timber. Her expression was troubled, her hands steady at her sides, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down.

"We have to do something," Taman said. "We can't just stand by and watch. The weight is building. The scales are tipping. If we don't act, if we don't stand against Arpin, then we're complicit. We're part of the problem."

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "I know, Taman. I know the weight is building. I can feel it too. But we can't confront Arpin outright. Not yet. Not like this. If we do, we'll be beaten, locked away, just like Hiram. And that won't help anyone. That won't change anything."

Taman felt frustration building. "Then what? What do we do? We can't just wait. We can't just stand by. The weight is building, and if we don't do something, something will break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the weight from breaking. But we have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to wait for the right moment. And when it comes, we'll be ready. We'll stand. We'll act. But not yet. Not like this."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand action, wanted to find a way forward. But he knew Sela was right. Confronting Arpin now would only make things worse. It would put them at risk, put their family at risk, and it wouldn't change anything. The crowd was with Arpin, with Isaac, with the coin that promised order. They wouldn't listen. They wouldn't believe. They would only see him as a troublemaker.

But the weight was building. The scales were tipping. And waiting felt wrong, felt like surrender, felt like complicity.

The hawk appeared then, circling low over the settlement, its wings beating the air. Taman watched it, felt the weight of its attention, felt the way it marked this moment, this turning point. The bird made slow, patient circles, and then it dove, dropping something at Taman's feet.

A feather.

Dark, sleek, catching the light. Taman picked it up, feeling its weight, its texture, and he felt something shift, something change. The hawk had chosen him, had marked him, had given him a message he couldn't read.

He looked up, searching for the bird, but it was gone, vanished into the sky without a sound. Only the feather remained, a sign, a warning, a message from a witness who saw everything, who marked turning points, who knew what was coming.

That night, Taman dreamed of a road.

It was a clear path, leading out of the valley, away from the settlement, away from Arpin, away from the weight. The road was smooth, well-traveled, and it promised freedom, escape, a way out.

In the dream, he walked the road, feeling the weight lift from his shoulders, feeling the scales balance, feeling the world right itself. The settlement faded behind him, and the mountain faded, and everything felt light, free, balanced.

He woke with the dream still fresh in his mind, the road clear, the path obvious. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that he had to find it. He had to leave. He had to escape. He had to find a way out of the valley, away from the weight, away from the scales that were tipping, away from the something that was coming.

The feather was still there, on the ground beside his bed, dark and sleek, catching the morning light. The hawk had chosen him. The road was calling. And he was determined to find it.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 12

Taman found himself at the missionary's chapel the next morning, drawn by desperation and the memory of Boone's silence, of Arpin's tightening grip, of the weight building with nowhere to go. The chapel stood at the edge of the settlement, crooked and weathered, a small structure that seemed to lean away from the fort as if trying to escape the weight pressing down.

He hesitated at the door, his hand on the rough wood, and he could hear the missionary's voice inside, muttering, chanting, speaking to walls that didn't answer back. The sound was familiar, a rhythm he'd heard before—half prayer, half madness, all weight.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The missionary sat on a low stool in the corner, his gaunt frame hunched over a worn Bible, his fingers tracing words that seemed to shift under his touch. He wore dark clothes that hung loose on his thin body, and he moved like a shade even when still, as if he existed half in this world and half in another.

"Ah," the missionary said without looking up. "The tracker returns. The boy who follows circles. The one who carries weight in his pouch and fear in his heart."

Taman stepped closer, his boots scuffing the dirt floor. "I need guidance. I need direction. Boone won't stand with me. Arpin's grip is tightening. The weight is building, and I don't know what to do."

The missionary looked up then, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing things Taman couldn't see. "Direction?" he said, his voice rising. "You want direction? I'll give you direction. The scales are tipping. The mountain is listening. The weight shifts, and you carry it, and you will carry it until it breaks you or you break it."

He stood abruptly, his movements jerky, unsteady, and he began to pace the small space, muttering, gesturing, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"Scales and sin," he said. "Weight and wickedness. Christ's cross was heavy, boy. Heavy as mountains. Heavy as the weight you carry. Heavy as the weight your sister carries. Christ's cross was no lighter than your sister's. No lighter. No lighter at all."

Taman felt frustration building. He'd come for answers, for clarity, for something he could use, something he could act on. But the missionary's words were riddles wrapped in madness, warnings without direction, prophecies without paths.

"The mountain watches," the missionary continued, his voice rising, cracking. "The mountain waits. The scales tip, and the weight accumulates, and when it breaks, it breaks everything. Fire and ash and the split. The split comes. The split always comes."

He stopped pacing and turned to face Taman directly, his eyes wild with something that looked like fear and prophecy mixed together. "You think you can escape it? You think you can outrun it? The weight follows. The weight always follows. It's part of you now. Part of what you carry. Part of who you are."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand something useful, something actionable. But the missionary's words, though mad, rang with a truth that made his chest tight. The weight did follow. It was part of him. He'd known it, felt it, carried it. And running wouldn't help. Running never helped.

The missionary began muttering again, his words coming faster, tumbling over each other like water over rocks. "The crooked scales call crooked ends. The split comes. The mountain breathes. The weight shifts. The scales tip. Fire. Ash. The split. Always the split."

Taman felt something break inside him. He'd come for guidance, for a path forward, for something that would help him save his family, save Sela, save them all. But there was no guidance here. No path. Only madness and riddles and warnings of things to come.

He turned to leave, his shoulders heavy, his heart sinking. He'd wasted his time. There was no help here. No guidance. No direction. Only madness and the weight pressing down, and the knowledge that something was coming, something that would break everything.

But just as his hand touched the door, the missionary's voice stopped him.

"Wait," the missionary said, his voice suddenly clearer, more focused. "Wait. You want direction? I'll give you direction. I keep a wagon. Bound for the east fort. I know men there. Men who will listen. Men who understand balance. Men who see the weight and know what it means."

Taman turned back, his heart racing. The east fort. The road from his dream. The escape he'd been seeking. "When?" he said. "When do you leave?"

The missionary hesitated, his eyes shifting, looking past Taman toward the door, and Taman felt something change in the air, something shift, something heavy pressing down.

"Soon," the missionary said, his voice faltering. "Soon. But you must be careful. You must be quiet. The weight follows. The weight always follows."

And then, as if on cue, Taman heard footsteps outside, heard the sound of someone approaching the chapel, and he felt the weight in the air shift, felt something press down, felt something squeeze.

The missionary's voice cut off mid-verse, as if unseen fingers had pinched it shut. His mouth worked, but no sound came out. His eyes widened, and he looked at Taman with something that looked like fear, like recognition, like understanding of what was coming.

Taman turned toward the door, and he saw Isaac walking past the chapel, his hand buried deep in his pocket, his thumb working something there—something brass, something that caught the light like fire. Isaac didn't look at the chapel, didn't glance toward the door, but his presence was enough, his coin was enough, to silence the missionary's voice, to choke his words, to press the weight down until even madness couldn't speak.

Isaac passed by, and the missionary's voice returned, shaky, uncertain, but the moment had changed. The weight had shifted. The scales had tipped.

"The coin," the missionary whispered, his voice barely audible. "The coin bends truth. The coin bends words. The coin bends even verses. Even mine. Even God's."

He looked at Taman, his eyes wild with fear and understanding. "Be careful, boy. Be careful. The coin sees. The coin hears. The coin knows. And if you go east, if you take my wagon, the coin will know. The weight will know. And it will follow."

But Taman had already made up his mind. The road. The east fort. The escape. It was what he'd dreamed of. What he'd been seeking. What the hawk's feather had marked him for. And he wasn't going to let riddles and warnings stop him. He wasn't going to let fear stop him. He wasn't going to let the weight stop him.

"I'll take it," Taman said. "I'll take the wagon. I'll go east. I'll find the men who listen. I'll find the balance. I'll find a way to break Arpin's grip."

The missionary looked at him, his expression troubled, his eyes seeing things Taman couldn't see. "The weight follows," he said again. "The weight always follows. But maybe. Maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance, maybe there's a way. Maybe there's hope."

Taman felt something shift, something change. The road. The path. The escape. It was real. It was possible. And he was going to take it.

He left the chapel with the missionary's words ringing in his ears, with the weight pressing down, with the knowledge that Isaac's coin had heard, had seen, had known. But he didn't care. He was going east. He was going to find help. He was going to break the circle, break the chains, break the weight that was crushing them all.

The hawk's feather was still in his pocket, dark and sleek, a sign, a mark, a message he was finally beginning to understand. The road was calling. The east was waiting. And he was going to answer.

The weight would follow. He knew that now. The weight always followed. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understood balance, maybe he could find a way to share it, to bear it, to break it.

Maybe he could find a way to save them all.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and Isaac's coin glowed faintly in the darkness, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.

# Chapter 13
---

Taman slipped away at dawn, the missionary's wagon waiting at the edge of the settlement like a promise, like a door opening to somewhere else. He'd told Sela the night before, whispering in the dark, explaining the plan, the road, the east fort, the men who would listen.

She'd listened in silence, her expression troubled but understanding, and then she'd pressed her hand to his chest, a warmth that stayed there even after she'd pulled away.

"Be careful," she'd said. "The weight follows. The weight always follows. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance, maybe there's a way."

The warmth of her blessing felt like a weight in his chest, heavy and comforting all at once, a reminder of what he was fighting for, of who he was protecting, of why he had to go, why he had to try.

He climbed into the wagon, the missionary already on the bench, his Bible in his lap, his mutterings starting up like a rhythm, like a chant, like a prayer that never ended. The horses shifted, restless, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down—the leaving, the going, the unknown that lay ahead.

They pulled away from the settlement slowly, the wagon creaking, the horses' hooves muffled in the morning mist. Taman looked back once, saw the palisade walls fading into the haze, saw the mountain looming behind them like a sentinel, like a warning, like a promise of things to come.

And then they were on the road, heading east, and the settlement faded behind them, and the weight felt different, felt lighter, felt like something he could carry, like something he could bear.

The road east was steadier than the paths around the settlement, the ground firmer, the way clearer. The tremors that had been shaking the fort for weeks faded behind them, and Taman felt something ease in his chest, felt something lift from his shoulders, felt the weight shift, felt the scales balance.

For the first time in weeks, he heard birdsong without echo, without the sound of the mountain groaning underneath, without the feel of weight pressing down. The sky opened above them, clear and blue, and the air felt different, felt cleaner, felt like it carried no ash, no smoke, no warning of things to come.

The missionary muttered scripture beside him, his voice a steady rhythm, words from the Bible tumbling together with warnings of scales and sin, of weight and wickedness, of the split that was coming. The verses mixed and merged until they made no sense, until they were just sounds, just noise, just the ramblings of a man who saw too much and understood too little.

But the wheels rolled smooth beneath them, the road steady, the journey easy, as though the road itself were lighter, as though the weight didn't follow, as though they'd left it all behind, as though they'd found a way to escape.

They traveled for hours, the missionary's mutterings a constant background noise, the wagon creaking, the horses steady, the road stretching ahead like a promise. Taman felt the weight of the pouch at his side, felt the coin in his pocket, felt the hawk's feather tucked away, and he wondered if maybe this was it, maybe this was the escape, maybe this was the way out.

They came to a river in the late afternoon, the water clear and cold, running over stones that glinted in the sunlight. The missionary pulled the wagon to a stop, and Taman climbed down, stretching his legs, feeling the stiffness in his back, the weariness in his bones.

As they prepared to cross, figures appeared on the far bank—people moving with purpose, with intention, with a rhythm that spoke of belonging, of knowing the land, of being part of it.

Taman recognized them immediately. His mother's people. The tribe. The ones who had warned her, who had seen the weight coming, who had known what Arpin would bring.

They crossed the river carefully, the wagon swaying in the current, and when they reached the far bank, the tribal people were waiting, their expressions guarded, their eyes watching, their hands ready.

They scorned the missionary immediately, turning away from him, ignoring his mutterings, dismissing him as mad, as dangerous, as someone who brought weight and wickedness in his wake. But they spoke softly with Taman, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes seeing something in him that they recognized, that they understood.

"You carry weight, boy," an elder said, her voice steady, her eyes old and knowing. "I can see it in you. In the way you stand. In the way you carry yourself. The weight follows you. You cannot outrun it. It's part of you now. Part of what you are."

Taman felt something sink in his chest. He'd hoped, he'd believed, he'd thought that leaving the settlement would mean leaving the weight behind, would mean finding a way to escape it, to be free of it. But the elder's words rang true, felt right, felt like truth.

"I know," he said. "I know the weight follows. But maybe in the east, maybe with men who understand balance—"

"Balance is not the absence of weight," the elder interrupted, her voice sharp but not unkind. "Balance is the sharing of weight. The distribution of it. The understanding that no one person should carry it all, that no one person should bear it alone."

She looked at him, her eyes seeing deeper than he wanted them to. "Your sister carries weight too. I can feel it from here. Her gift. Her burden. Her way of holding it so it doesn't break others. That burden will draw hunters, boy. Men who want to use it. Men who want to break it. Men who see her gift and see power instead of responsibility."

Taman felt something cold in his chest, something heavy. The elder's words were warning and prophecy both, and he knew she was right. Sela's gift was rare, powerful, and men like Arpin would want it, would hunt it, would break it if they could.

"She needs protection," the elder said. "She needs people who understand balance, who share weight, who know that gifts are responsibilities, not weapons. The east fort might have such people. But be careful. Not everyone who speaks of balance understands it."

As they spoke, a young woman approached, her movements graceful, her eyes sharp and curious. She was perhaps a year or two older than Taman, with dark hair braided back, and she moved with the confidence of someone who knew the land, who knew her place in it.

"This is Mira," the elder said. "Her father trades with Fort Shadow. She knows the way things are. She might help you understand what you're walking into."

Mira nodded, her eyes scanning Taman's face, taking in his posture, his expression, the way he carried himself. "I've heard stories about Fort Shadow," she said, her voice clear, her words direct. "About the trader who came. About the ledgers. About the weight building. And I've heard whispers about a girl who can hold weight, who can steady it, who can keep it from breaking others."

She stepped closer, her eyes seeing something in him that made her expression soften. "Is it true? Does your sister have the gift?"

Taman hesitated, unsure how much to share, how much to trust. But there was something in Mira's eyes, something in the way she held herself, that made him think she understood, that made him think she could help.

"Yes," he said finally. "She does. She can hold weight. She can steady it. She can keep it from breaking others. But it costs her. It's exhausting. And men like Arpin would want to use it, would want to break it, would want to turn it into a weapon."

Mira nodded, her expression serious. "Then she needs protection. She needs people who understand balance, who share weight, who won't use her gift for power. My father has friends at the east fort. Men who understand such things. I'll help you find them."

She looked at him, her eyes kind but protective, and Taman felt something ease in his chest, felt something shift. Maybe he wasn't alone. Maybe there were people who understood. Maybe there was a way.

They made camp that night near the river, the tribal people sharing their fire, their food, their stories. Taman tasted fresh roots and smoked fish, foods he hadn't had in months, and he felt how different the world was when the scales were level, when the weight was shared, when people worked together instead of against each other.

The missionary muttered scripture in the corner, ignored by everyone, his words fading into the background, his warnings lost in the comfort of the fire, the warmth of the company, the feeling of balance, of rightness, of things being as they should be.

The hawk circled above them, its cry sharp but not frantic, a witness marking the moment, seeing the shift, the change, the turning point. And for the first time in months, Taman slept without dreams, without visions of the mountain, without the weight pressing down, without the sense that something was coming, something that would break everything.

But in his gut, even as he slept, even in the peace of the moment, he knew this calm was not his—not yet. The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, he would have to face it, would have to bear it, would have to find a way to share it, to balance it, to keep it from breaking everything.

The east fort waited ahead, and the men who might listen, and the hope of balance, of protection, of a way forward. But the weight followed. And Sela was still at Fort Shadow, and Boone was still bound to the ledgers, and Arpin was still tightening his grip.

The calm was welcome, necessary, a chance to breathe, to steady, to prepare. But it was temporary. And Taman knew that sooner or later, he would have to go back, would have to face what he'd left behind, would have to find a way to save them all.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And he would carry it, would bear it, would find a way to share it, to balance it, to keep it from breaking everything.

But not yet. Not tonight. Tonight he would rest, would breathe, would let the calm settle, would let the scales balance, would let the weight rest.

Tomorrow he would face the east fort, and the men who might listen, and the hope of balance, of protection, of a way forward.

Tomorrow he would begin to understand what it meant to share weight, to balance it, to keep it from breaking everything.

But tonight, he would rest. And for the first time in months, that was enough.

The eastern fort rose larger than Fort Shadow, a sprawling settlement built with care and maintained with pride. Its palisade walls stood tall and strong, but unlike Fort Shadow's walls, which seemed to lean inward with fear and oppression, these walls were marked with painted signs of welcome—patterns and symbols that spoke of openness, of community, of a place where people belonged, where they thrived, where they found balance.

Wagons moved through the gates in a steady stream, traders calling out, voices cheerful, the sound of commerce that felt different from Arpin's ledger-bound trade. Here there was barter and negotiation, but it felt fair, felt balanced, felt like both sides won, like both sides shared the weight, like both sides understood that trade was partnership, not conquest.

The missionary blathered at the gate, his voice rising in pitch, his words tumbling over each other in a rush of scripture and warnings, but the guards merely waved him through, their expressions tolerant, amused, as if he were a harmless nuisance, a madman to be tolerated but not feared.

Taman felt something ease in his chest as he passed through the gates, felt something lift from his shoulders, felt the weight shift, felt the scales balance. The air felt different here, cleaner, lighter, carrying no ash, no smoke, no warning of things to come. The ground beneath his feet felt steady, solid, as though the earth itself were balanced, as though the weight was shared, as though everything was as it should be.

The fort hummed with balance, a vibration Taman felt more than heard, a sense of rightness, of equilibrium, of weight distributed fairly, of choices made with care, of people working together instead of against each other.

Animals moved through the yards—pigs and chickens and horses—and they were fat and healthy, their coats glossy, their eyes clear, their movements steady and calm. No sick animals here. No foamed mouths. No staggering steps. No mysterious deaths. The animals thrived, and their thriving spoke of balance, of weight shared fairly, of land that was cared for, of choices that didn't break things.

Children ran between the buildings, their laughter ringing in the air, clear and joyful, the sound of play without fear, of childhood without weight, of life without the constant pressure of scales tipping, of choices breaking things. Taman watched them, and he felt something ache in his chest—a longing, a wish, a sense of what could be, of what should be, of what balance looked like when it worked.

The missionary muttered scripture beside him, but even his warnings seemed muted here, his words losing power in the face of balance, of rightness, of things being as they should be. The fort didn't need his warnings. It already understood balance. It already shared weight. It already knew what balance meant.

Mira led Taman through the settlement, her movements confident, her eyes scanning the faces, reading the signs, understanding the rhythms of the place. She knew people here, and they knew her, and there was warmth in the greetings, respect in the nods, a sense of community that Taman hadn't felt in months, hadn't felt since Arpin's arrival.

"They'll listen," Mira said, her voice low, her eyes steady. "They understand balance. They understand weight. They'll hear your story, and they'll understand what Arpin is doing, and they might help. But you need to be careful how you ask. Balance is delicate. They won't risk their own for strangers, not without good reason."

Taman nodded, understanding. Balance was delicate. Weight was shared carefully. People protected their own first, and Fort Shadow was not their own. They would listen, but they would not necessarily act, would not necessarily risk their balance for someone else's weight.

They reached a central hall, larger and more open than Fort Shadow's trading hall, and Taman saw a council gathered—traders, elders, people who moved with authority but not arrogance, who spoke with respect, who listened with care.

His mother's tribe was there too, their presence noted but not dominating, their voices heard but not demanding. They sat with the council, but their posture spoke of independence, of their own balance, of choices made on their own terms.

Mira introduced Taman, her voice clear, her words careful, and the council listened, their expressions serious, their eyes seeing something in Taman that they recognized, that they understood.

Taman spoke of Fort Shadow, of Arpin's ledgers, of the weight building, of the scales tipping, of the tremors and the ash and the sick animals. He spoke of Sela's gift, of her ability to hold weight, of how men like Arpin would hunt it, would use it, would break it. He spoke of the need for help, for balance, for a way to share the weight, to protect his sister, to save his family.

The council listened, their expressions shifting from curiosity to concern, from understanding to caution. Most dismissed him, their voices polite but firm, explaining that Fort Shadow was not their concern, that they could not risk their own balance for someone else's weight, that they had their own people to protect, their own choices to make.

But one trader stepped forward, a man with graying hair and steady eyes, his movements calm, his voice measured. "I can open a supply route," he said. "Quiet. Under the table. Goods moving west, help reaching those who need it. Not much, but something. A way to share the weight, to balance the scales a little. It won't break Arpin's grip, but it might loosen it. It might give people hope."

Taman felt something lift in his chest, felt something shift. It wasn't everything he'd hoped for, wasn't the army, wasn't the rescue, wasn't the breaking of Arpin's grip. But it was something. It was a start. It was a way to share weight, to balance scales, to give people hope.

"Thank you," he said, his voice tight with emotion. "Thank you. It's more than I hoped for. It's a start."

The trader nodded, his expression understanding. "Balance is slow, boy. Weight is shared carefully. But sometimes a little weight shared is enough to tip the scales the right way. Sometimes a little balance is enough to give people hope."

Mira pulled Taman aside as the council continued its discussion, her expression serious, her eyes seeing something he didn't want to see.

"Arpin's grip won't weaken," she said, her voice low, urgent. "Not because of supply routes. Not because of hope. He's bound people with ledgers and debt and obligation. He's made them believe they need him. He's made them afraid to leave. And as long as they're bound, as long as they're afraid, his grip stays strong."

She looked at him, her eyes kind but direct. "The only way to break his grip is to break the bindings. To get people out. To give them a place to go. To show them that balance exists elsewhere, that weight can be shared, that they don't have to live under his thumb."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Bring your family here, Taman. Bring Sela. Bring Boone. Bring your mother. Bring them east, to a place where the scales are balanced, where weight is shared, where they won't be hunted, where they can live whole. That's the only way. That's the real way to break his grip."

Taman felt something ache in his chest, a longing so sharp it hurt. He wanted that. Wanted to bring his family here, wanted to see them safe, wanted to see them whole, wanted to see them living in balance, in peace, in a place where the scales were level, where weight was shared, where they could thrive.

But he also felt the weight of impossibility, of obstacles too large to overcome, of bindings too strong to break.

"The ledgers," he said. "The debts. Arpin has them bound. They can't leave. Even if they wanted to, they can't leave."

Mira's expression softened. "The ledgers are paper, Taman. Paper and ink. They only have power if people believe in them. If people see a way out, if people see balance elsewhere, they'll find a way. They'll break free. They'll choose balance over bindings."

She looked at him, her eyes seeing deeper than he wanted them to. "But you have to show them the way. You have to give them hope. You have to plant the seed of what could be, and let it grow."

Taman felt something shift, something change. The seed of what could be. The hope of balance. The promise of a place where weight was shared, where scales were level, where they could live whole.

His mother's tribe spoke then, their voices calm, their words careful. "We will not aid Arpin," an elder said, her voice steady. "Nor will we raise hand against him. Our balance is our own. Our weight is our own. We will protect our people, and we will share weight with those who share with us, but we will not risk our balance for another's war."

Taman nodded, understanding. Their balance was their own. Their choice was their own. They would help where they could, but they would not risk everything for strangers, would not break their own balance for someone else's weight.

It was fair. It was balanced. It was what balance meant—sharing weight carefully, protecting your own, helping where you could without breaking yourself.

A sympathetic elder from the fort stepped forward, his expression kind, his eyes understanding. "You could stay here," he said. "You could make a life here. We have a place for you. A place where your sister would not be hunted, where her gift would be respected, where weight would be shared, where you could live whole."

He looked at Taman, his eyes seeing something that made his expression soften. "You've tasted balance now. You know what it feels like. You could have that. You could live that. You and your family. All of you. Safe. Whole. Balanced."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt something crack. The offer was real, was genuine, was everything he'd dreamed of. A place to stay. A place where Sela would be safe. A place where weight was shared. A place where they could live whole.

He almost said yes. Almost took it. Almost chose the peace, the balance, the safety. Almost walked away from Fort Shadow, from Arpin, from the weight, from the scales that were tipping, from the something that was coming.

But then he saw their faces in his mind—Boone, still bound to the ledgers, still believing in the system, still hoping for freedom through accounting. His mother, still at the fort, still under Arpin's thumb, still bearing the weight of choices she'd never made. Sela, still holding weight, still steadying it, still protecting others, still at risk, still hunted, still carrying a burden that would draw men like Arpin, men who would use it, break it, turn it into a weapon.

Their faces held him like a tether, pulled him back, reminded him of what he was fighting for, of who he was protecting, of why he had to go back, why he had to try, why he had to find a way to save them all.

"I can't," he said, his voice tight, his chest aching. "I can't stay. Not without them. Not while they're still there, still bound, still at risk. I have to go back. I have to find a way. I have to bring them here, to this balance, to this peace, to this place where weight is shared and scales are level."

The elder nodded, his expression understanding. "The weight follows, boy. You carry it, and you'll carry it until you share it or it breaks you. But maybe by going back, by trying, by planting the seed of what could be, you'll find a way to share it. You'll find a way to bring them here. You'll find a way to balance the scales."

Taman left the fort with provisions packed carefully, with a map marked with routes and safe places, with the bitter knowledge that he had tasted balance—and walked away from it.

The seed was planted. The hope was there. The promise of what could be. And he would carry that with him, would share it, would show his family that balance existed elsewhere, that weight could be shared, that they didn't have to live under Arpin's thumb, that they could choose a different path, a different balance, a different way.

The eastern fort faded behind him, and the road stretched ahead, leading back to Fort Shadow, back to Arpin, back to the weight, back to the scales that were tipping, back to the something that was coming.

But he carried something new now—the memory of balance, the taste of peace, the hope of what could be, the seed of a different future.

And maybe that was enough. Maybe the seed would grow. Maybe the hope would spread. Maybe he could find a way to bring them all here, to this balance, to this peace, to this place where weight was shared and scales were level.

Maybe he could find a way to save them all.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. But now he knew what balance felt like, knew what sharing weight meant, knew what they were fighting for, what they were working toward.

And that knowledge felt like a weapon, like a shield, like a way forward, like hope.

# Chapter 15

The first wagons from the east arrived at Fort Shadow quietly, slipping through the gates in the early morning mist, their drivers moving with purpose but not urgency, their loads small but honest. Taman watched from the edge of the central yard, his heart racing, his hands clenched at his sides, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down.

The wagons carried goods—flour, salt, tools, things that were needed, things that were scarce, things that Arpin controlled and rationed and used to bind people with debt and obligation. But these goods came without ledgers, without debt, without the chains that Arpin used to control, to bind, to break.

The drivers moved quickly, unloading their cargo, speaking in low voices, their eyes scanning the fort, taking in the palisade walls, the settlement under strain, the weight pressing down. They understood what they were doing, understood the risk, understood that they were sharing weight, that they were tipping scales, that they were planting seeds of hope in ground that Arpin had claimed as his own.

Taman felt something lift in his chest as he watched, felt something shift, felt the scales tilt ever so slightly in his family's favor. It wasn't much. It wasn't enough to break Arpin's grip. It wasn't enough to free everyone. But it was something. It was a start. It was a way to share weight, to balance scales, to give people hope.

Boone found him at the edge of the yard, his expression troubled, his voice cautious. "It's good," he said, his words careful, measured. "The goods are good. The people need them. It's a change. A real change."

But his voice was tight, worried, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Boone saw the change, but he also saw the risk, saw what it meant, saw how Arpin would respond.

"Arpin will see this as theft," Boone continued, his voice low. "Not trade. Not help. Theft. He'll see it as a challenge. As someone moving against him. As someone trying to break his control. And he'll respond. He'll tighten his grip. He'll make things worse."

Taman felt frustration building. "Then what? What do we do? We can't just stand by and let him control everything. We can't just accept the ledgers and the debt and the binding. We have to try. We have to do something."

Boone's expression softened. "I know, Taman. I know. And maybe this is it. Maybe this is the start. Maybe the supply route will help. Maybe it will loosen his grip. Maybe it will give people hope. But we have to be careful. We have to be smart. We can't let him see it as a threat. We can't let him know that someone is moving against him."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand action, wanted to find a way to break Arpin's grip completely. But he knew Boone was right. Arpin would see this as a threat, would respond with force, would tighten his control. And if they moved too quickly, if they challenged him too directly, they would all suffer.

The townsfolk gathered slowly, drawn by the whispers, by the news of new goods, by the hope that someone beyond Arpin's ledger still saw them, still cared about them, still remembered that they existed, that they mattered, that they deserved better than debt and obligation and chains.

They spoke in low voices, their words careful, their eyes scanning, watching for Arpin, for Isaac, for anyone who might report them, might turn them in, might make them pay for daring to hope.

"New goods," someone whispered. "Real goods. Not ledger-bound. Not debt-ridden. Just goods. Fair goods."

"Someone's helping," another voice added. "Someone beyond the fort. Someone who sees us. Someone who cares."

"They're risking something," a third voice said. "Coming here. Bringing goods. Helping us. They're risking Arpin's wrath. They're risking his coin. They're risking everything."

The whispers spread, growing in volume, growing in hope, and Taman felt something shift, felt something change. The seeds were planted. The hope was spreading. The weight was being shared. The scales were tilting, ever so slightly, toward balance.

Sela found him later that day, her expression calm but understanding, her eyes seeing something in him that made her smile.

"You've done a good thing," she said, her voice soft, her words careful. "You've given people hope. You've shown them that balance exists elsewhere, that weight can be shared, that they don't have to live under Arpin's thumb. That's something. That's real."

But her warning lingered, her words heavy with truth: "The scales never stop moving, Taman. They're always shifting. Always tilting. Always responding to choices, to weight, to the things we do. And every choice we make, every weight we shift, every scale we tip—it all matters. It all adds up. And sooner or later, it will all come due."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. The scales never stopped moving. Every choice mattered. Every weight shifted. Every scale tipped. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

He'd bent the scales in his family's favor, had shared weight, had given people hope. But the scales would respond. The weight would shift. The choices would add up. And sooner or later, someone would pay the price.

Isaac found Arpin in the trading hall that evening, his expression troubled, his hand working the coin in his pocket, the brass warming under his thumb, catching the light like fire.

"Something's slipping," Isaac muttered, his voice low, urgent. "The people are whispering. They're talking about new goods, about someone helping, about hope. They're daring to think there's a way out, a way beyond your ledgers, a way beyond your control."

Arpin's gaze sharpened like a drawn blade, his expression dangerous, his voice cold. "Someone is moving against me. Someone is challenging my control. Someone thinks they can break my grip, can share weight without my permission, can tip scales without my consent."

He stood, his movements sharp, deliberate, and Isaac felt the weight of the moment pressing down, felt the scales shifting, felt something dangerous building.

"Find out who," Arpin said, his voice hard. "Find out who's bringing the goods. Find out who's helping. Find out who thinks they can challenge me, can move against me, can break my control. And when you find them, bring them to me. I'll show them what happens when someone tries to tip scales without my permission."

Isaac nodded, his hand working the coin harder, faster, the brass warming, the light intensifying. The coin saw. The coin heard. The coin knew. And it would find them. It would root them out. It would show them what happened when someone tried to share weight without permission.

That night, Taman watched his mother run her fingers across the provisions they'd received—flour, salt, tools, things they needed, things they'd been denied, things that had been rationed, controlled, used to bind them.

Her movements were careful, deliberate, her fingers testing the weight of each item, reading its texture, its quality, its worth. Her expression was troubled, her eyes seeing something that made her both proud and fearful.

"You've done well, Taman," she said, her voice soft, her words careful. "You've found a way to help. You've found a way to share weight. You've found a way to give people hope. That's something. That's real."

But her silence was heavy, weighted, and Taman felt something ache in his chest. She was proud of him, proud of what he'd done, proud of the hope he'd brought. But she was also afraid—afraid of what it meant, afraid of how Arpin would respond, afraid of the weight that would come, afraid of the scales that would tip.

A tremor shuddered through the ground that night, strong enough to rattle crockery from a shelf, strong enough to shake the walls, strong enough to remind everyone that the mountain was still there, still listening, still responding to the weight, to the scales, to the choices that were being made.

The tremor lasted longer than the ones before, and when it stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous, weighted with warning.

And through the silence, the missionary's laughter drifted across the yard like broken glass, sharp and cutting, a sound that spoke of madness and prophecy, of warnings ignored, of things to come.

"Tremors and weight," the missionary called out, his voice rising in the darkness. "Tremors and weight. The scales tip. The mountain shakes. The weight accumulates. And when it breaks, it breaks everything. Fire and ash and the split. The split always comes."

Taman stood in the dark, clutching his pouch, feeling the weight of it, the texture of it, the reminder of what he carried, of what he was fighting for, of who he was protecting.

He'd won a sliver of ground. He'd bent the scales in his family's favor. He'd shared weight. He'd given people hope. He'd shown them that balance existed elsewhere, that weight could be shared, that they didn't have to live under Arpin's thumb.

But he'd also painted a target across all their backs.

Arpin would respond. Isaac would hunt. The coin would find them. And sooner or later, someone would pay the price. Someone would bear the weight. Someone would tip the scales too far.

The scales never stopped moving. Every choice mattered. Every weight shifted. Every scale tipped. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Taman felt the weight pressing down, felt the scales shifting, felt something dangerous building, something that would break, something that would change everything.

The tremors. The ash. The split. The missionary's warnings. The weight accumulating. The scales tipping.

Something was coming. Something was building. Something that would break, that would change, that would force choices, that would demand weight, that would tip scales until everything came due.

And when it did, they would all be caught in it.

All of them.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 16

Taman returned from the east with the taste of balance still fresh in his mouth, with the memory of the eastern fort vivid in his mind—the painted signs of welcome, the healthy animals, the laughing children, the air clear of ash, the sense of rightness, of equilibrium, of weight shared fairly.

He found his family that evening, gathering them in the small cabin they shared, his words urgent, his voice tight with hope and desperation.

"There's a place," he said, his words tumbling over each other in his rush to explain. "An eastern fort. Larger than this. Balanced. The scales are level there. Weight is shared. People work together. The animals are healthy, the children laugh, the air carries no ash. There's balance there. Real balance. We could go there. All of us. We could leave. We could find a way out. We could live whole."

He spoke of the fort, of the council, of the trader who'd offered to help, of Mira and her offer of friendship, of the elder who'd said Sela wouldn't be hunted there, that her gift would be respected, that they could live whole.

"We could go," he said, his voice rising with hope. "We could leave Fort Shadow, leave Arpin, leave the ledgers and the debt and the weight. We could find balance. We could share weight. We could live whole."

But Boone shook his head, his expression troubled, his voice careful. "No, Taman. No. The fort is our home. It's always been our home. And Arpin's grip is strong, I know that. I've seen it. I've felt it. But it's survivable. If we're smart. If we're careful. If we play the game, learn the system, use the ledgers instead of fighting them, then we can survive. We can make it work. We can find a way to live under his thumb without breaking."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away before it had ever been real. "Survivable? Is that what you want? To survive under his thumb? To play his game? To accept the ledgers and the debt and the binding? That's not living, Boone. That's just existing. That's just waiting for him to tighten his grip even more, to bind us tighter, to break us completely."

Boone's expression hardened. "And leaving is living? Running away? Abandoning our home? What about everyone else? What about the people who can't leave? What about the people who are bound too tight to escape? Do we just abandon them? Do we just leave them to Arpin's mercy?"

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to explain, wanted to make Boone see. But he knew it wouldn't help. Boone believed in the fort, believed in home, believed that survival was enough, that playing the game was better than breaking it.

Their mother listened in silence, her expression troubled, her eyes shadowed by memories of her tribe's warnings—warnings about weight, about balance, about the cost of choices, about the price of survival.

She'd been warned, long ago, before Arpin's arrival, before the ledgers, before the weight built. Her people had seen the weight coming, had known what Arpin would bring, had tried to warn her, to protect her, to show her a different path.

But she'd chosen the fort, chosen home, chosen the risk of weight over the safety of balance. And now she was bound, weighted, trapped by choices she'd made long ago, by debts she'd never meant to take, by chains she couldn't break.

She looked at Taman, her eyes old and knowing, and Taman saw something in them that made his chest ache—pride and fear and understanding all mixed together.

"You've found balance," she said, her voice soft, her words careful. "You've seen what it looks like. You've tasted what it feels like. That's something. That's real. And maybe, maybe you're right. Maybe leaving is the answer. Maybe balance is worth the risk."

But her silence was heavy, weighted, and Taman felt something shift. She wanted to believe, wanted to hope, wanted to leave. But she was also bound, weighted, trapped by choices and debts and chains she couldn't break.

Sela sat quietly, her expression troubled, her hands steady at her sides, and Taman saw something in her eyes that made his chest tighten.

"I want to believe you," she said, her voice soft, her words careful. "I want to believe that balance exists elsewhere, that weight can be shared, that we can live whole. And maybe we can. Maybe leaving is the answer. Maybe the east fort is the way."

But she looked at Boone, her expression softening, and Taman felt something break in his chest. "But I won't abandon him, Taman. I won't leave him behind. He's family. He's blood. And if he won't go, then I can't go. Not without him. Not without his consent."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away. Sela wouldn't leave without Boone, and Boone wouldn't leave at all. And without them, without his family, the east fort meant nothing. The balance meant nothing. The hope meant nothing.

"We could convince him," Taman said, his voice desperate. "We could make him see. We could show him that balance is worth the risk, that leaving is worth the cost, that survival isn't enough, that we deserve more than just existing under Arpin's thumb."

But Sela shook her head, her expression sad but firm. "It's his choice, Taman. His choice to make. His weight to bear. His scale to tip. And we can't make that choice for him. We can't force him to leave. We can't break his bindings for him. He has to do that himself. He has to choose it himself. And until he does, until he's ready, until he sees that survival isn't enough, we have to stay. We have to wait. We have to bear the weight together."

Isaac found Boone later that day, his hand working the coin in his pocket, the brass warming under his thumb, catching the light like fire.

"I hear your brother's back," Isaac said, his voice smooth, his words careful. "I hear he's been to the east. I hear he's seen things. Heard things. Maybe even tasted things. Things like balance. Things like hope. Things like a way out."

Boone's expression shifted, his eyes wary, and Isaac felt something change in the air, felt the weight shift, felt the scales tip.

"Your brother wants to leave," Isaac continued, his voice low, urgent. "He wants to take your family east. He wants to abandon the fort, abandon your home, abandon everything you've built, everything you've worked for. He wants to run. To escape. To leave it all behind."

He leaned closer, his hand working the coin harder, the brass glowing faintly, the light intensifying. "But you know better, don't you? You know that running doesn't help. You know that leaving doesn't solve anything. You know that the fort is your home, that Arpin's grip is strong but survivable, that if you're smart, if you're careful, if you play the game, then you can survive. You can make it work."

His voice dropped to a whisper, and Boone felt something shift, felt the weight press down, felt the scales tip. "You have a duty here, Boone. A responsibility. An inheritance. This is your home. This is your place. This is where you belong. And your brother wants to take that away. He wants to abandon it. He wants to leave it all behind. But you won't let him, will you? You'll stay. You'll play the game. You'll survive. Because that's your duty. That's your responsibility. That's your inheritance."

Boone felt something break in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the weight of duty and responsibility pressing down. Isaac's words rang true, felt right, felt like truth. The fort was his home. Arpin's grip was strong but survivable. And if he was smart, if he was careful, if he played the game, then he could survive. He could make it work.

He nodded, his voice tight. "I know. I know my duty. I know my responsibility. I know where I belong. And I won't leave. I won't abandon it. I'll stay. I'll play the game. I'll survive."

Isaac smiled, his expression satisfied, and Boone felt something shift, felt the weight settle, felt the scales tip in Arpin's favor.

The missionary wandered through the square that afternoon, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over each other like stones rolling downhill.

"Roads and paths," he muttered, his voice carrying. "Roads and paths. All roads lead somewhere. All paths lead somewhere. But do they lead forward? Do they lead back? Do they lead somewhere new? Or do they just loop back, back to the beginning, back to where you started?"

He stopped, his eyes wild, his expression haunted. "All roads lead to scales. All paths lead to weight. Every choice you make, every path you take, every road you follow—it all leads back to the scales. It all leads back to weight. It all leads back to the beginning. The scales never stop moving. The weight never stops following. And every road, every path, every choice—it all loops back. It all leads to scales."

Taman watched him, felt something heavy in his chest, felt the weight of the missionary's words pressing down. All roads led to scales. All paths led to weight. And every choice, every path, every road—it all looped back. It all led to the beginning.

A tremor ran underfoot then, sudden and sharp, knocking apples from a vendor's cart, sending fruit rolling across the square, bouncing and tumbling like coins scattering.

The people jumped, startled, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened. But then they laughed, their voices nervous but relieved, dismissing it as clumsy luck, as a stumble, as nothing to worry about, nothing to fear.

"Just a stumble," someone said, their voice cheerful. "Just clumsy luck. Nothing to worry about. Nothing to fear."

But Taman felt the weight of it, felt the tremor in his bones, felt the scales shifting, felt something dangerous building, something that would break, something that would change everything.

He looked at his family—Boone, still bound to the ledgers, still believing in survival, still playing the game. His mother, still weighted by choices and debts and chains she couldn't break. Sela, still holding weight, still steadying it, still protecting others, still refusing to leave without Boone's consent.

And he felt the east slipping away, felt hope fading, felt the taste of balance fading from his mouth, felt the memory of the eastern fort growing dim, felt the promise of a different future fading into impossibility.

The fort was their home. Arpin's grip was strong but survivable. And if they were smart, if they were careful, if they played the game, then they could survive. They could make it work.

But survival wasn't enough. Existing wasn't living. And the east, the balance, the hope—it was all slipping away before it had ever been real.

All roads led to scales. All paths led to weight. And every choice, every path, every road—it all looped back. It all led to the beginning.

The scales never stopped moving. The weight never stopped following. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Taman felt the east slipping away before it was ever his, felt hope fading, felt the weight pressing down, felt the scales shifting, felt something dangerous building, something that would break, something that would change everything.

And when it did, they would all be caught in it.

All of them.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 17

Arpin called the settlement together the next morning, gathering them in the central yard, his expression calm but dangerous, his voice carrying over the crowd like a command, like a threat, like a promise of things to come.

Isaac stood at his side, his hand in his pocket, his thumb working the coin, the brass warming under his touch, catching the light like fire. His eyes scanned the crowd, reading faces, seeing fear, seeing suspicion, seeing the weight of debt and obligation pressing down.

Arpin unfolded a ledger, its pages thick with ink, with numbers, with debts and credits and obligations that stretched back months, back to his arrival, back to the first goods he'd brought, the first kindnesses he'd shown, the first chains he'd forged.

"New terms," Arpin announced, his voice clear, his words careful, deliberate. "New terms for trade. New terms for goods. New terms for everything. Fair terms. Balanced terms. Terms that protect everyone, that ensure everyone gets what they need, that make sure no one goes hungry, no one goes without, no one suffers."

But his words were lies, and everyone knew it. The terms weren't fair. They weren't balanced. They were chains, bindings, debts so deep no one could leave even if they wished, obligations so heavy no one could break free even if they tried.

"Every family," Arpin continued, his voice rising. "Every household. Every person. All bound together. All protected. All ensured. You take goods, you sign the ledger. You receive kindness, you owe the ledger. You get help, you pay the ledger. It's simple. It's fair. It's balanced. And it protects everyone."

He smiled, his expression cold, dangerous. "And once you're bound, once you're in the ledger, once you've signed your name, you're protected. You're ensured. You're taken care of. But you're also bound. You're also obligated. You're also mine."

Isaac stepped forward then, his hand still in his pocket, his thumb still working the coin. He pulled it out into the sunlight, holding it up, letting it catch the light, letting it flash once, brilliant and blinding.

The coin gleamed, brass and fire, its off-center starburst catching the light like a promise, like a threat, like something that bent truth and words and will.

The crowd stared, mesmerized, their eyes fixed on the coin, on the light, on the promise it seemed to offer—order, safety, protection, a way out of the weight, a way to balance the scales, a way to make everything right.

Isaac's voice rose, smooth and persuasive, his words wrapping around the crowd like chains, like bindings, like promises that felt real, that felt right, that felt like hope.

"This is order," Isaac said, his voice carrying. "This is balance. This is the way things should be. Fair trade. Fair debt. Fair obligation. Everyone protected. Everyone ensured. Everyone bound together. And once you're bound, once you're in the ledger, you're safe. You're protected. You're taken care of. But you're also mine."

The crowd cheered, their voices rising, their suspicion turning into applause, their fear turning into hope, their resistance turning into acceptance. The coin had done its work. The light had done its job. And the crowd was bound, was obligated, was caught in chains they couldn't see, couldn't feel, couldn't break.

Taman watched from the edge of the crowd, his heart racing, his hands clenched at his sides, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. Arpin had tightened his grip. He'd bound everyone deeper. He'd created chains no one could break. And the crowd was cheering, was accepting, was signing their names, was binding themselves deeper, was making the chains stronger.

He tried to rally a handful of neighbors, pulling them aside, his voice urgent, his words desperate.

"The east," he said, his voice low. "The eastern fort. Balance. Weight shared. Scales level. We could go there. We could leave. We could find a way out. We could live whole."

But they shook their heads, their expressions troubled, their eyes seeing something that made them afraid.

"The debt," someone said, their voice tight. "The ledger. I'm bound. I'm obligated. I can't leave. Not while I'm in debt. Not while my name's in the ledger. Arpin would hunt me. He'd find me. He'd make me pay. And I can't pay. Not yet. Not until the debt's cleared. And the debt never clears. It just gets deeper. It just gets heavier."

"The supply route," another voice added. "The goods. They help. They share weight. They balance scales. Maybe that's enough. Maybe we don't need to leave. Maybe we can survive here, under his thumb, playing his game, accepting the chains."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away. Their debts gagged their courage. Their obligations bound their will. Their chains held them tight, even when they wanted to break free, even when they knew they should leave, even when they saw the way out.

They were bound. They were obligated. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't see, couldn't feel.

Sela found him later, her expression troubled, her eyes seeing something that made her voice careful.

"Open defiance won't help," she said, her words soft, measured. "Not now. Not when Arpin's grip is so tight. Not when Isaac's coin is so strong. If we stand against them openly, if we challenge them directly, they'll bring the weight down harder on us. They'll tighten the chains. They'll bind us deeper. They'll break us completely."

Taman felt frustration building. "Then what? What do we do? We can't just stand by and watch. We can't just accept the chains. We can't just let them bind everyone deeper, tighter, stronger."

Sela's expression softened. "We hold. We steady. We do what we can to keep the weight from breaking. But we have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to wait for the right moment. And when it comes, we'll be ready. We'll stand. We'll act. But not now. Not like this."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand action, wanted to find a way to break the chains, to free everyone, to share the weight, to balance the scales. But he knew Sela was right. Open defiance would only make things worse. They had to be smart. They had to be careful. They had to wait.

Boone found him that evening, his expression troubled, his voice careful, and Taman saw something in his eyes that made his chest ache—conflict, doubt, the weight of choices he couldn't make, of bindings he couldn't break.

"Caught between brothers," Boone muttered, his voice low. "Caught between you and Arpin. Between leaving and staying. Between breaking the chains and playing the game. Between hope and survival."

He looked at Taman, his eyes seeing something that made his expression sad. "You want to leave. You want to break free. You want to find balance, to share weight, to live whole. And I want that too. I want it so bad it hurts."

But his voice was tight, troubled, and Taman felt something shift. "But the ledgers, Taman. The numbers. They don't lie. They show us where we stand, what we owe, what's owed to us. And if we understand them, if we learn to use them, then maybe we can make them work for us instead of against us. Maybe we can find a way to clear the debt, to break the chains, to free ourselves. But we can't do that by leaving. We can't do that by running. We have to do it by playing the game, by learning the system, by using the numbers instead of fighting them."

Taman felt something break in his chest. Boone was caught between brothers, between choices, between leaving and staying. And he'd chosen silence, chosen survival, chosen playing the game instead of breaking it.

"Numbers don't lie," Boone continued, his voice careful. "But they can be twisted. They can be used. They can be made to say what you want them to say. And if we learn to use them, if we learn to twist them, then maybe we can find a way out. Maybe we can clear the debt. Maybe we can break the chains. But not by leaving. Not by running. By staying. By playing. By using the system instead of fighting it."

Taman felt something sink in his chest. Boone had chosen. He'd chosen silence. He'd chosen survival. He'd chosen playing the game instead of breaking it. And Taman was alone. Alone in wanting to leave. Alone in wanting to break free. Alone in wanting balance, in wanting weight shared, in wanting to live whole.

The missionary lingered in the crowd that afternoon, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over each other like stones rolling downhill.

He recited scripture out of order, verses from the Bible mixed with warnings of scales and sin, of weight and wickedness, of the split that was coming. His words made no sense, were just sounds, just noise, just the ramblings of a man who saw too much and understood too little.

But in the midst of the chaos, in the noise and the nonsense, his voice rose, clear and sharp, his words cutting through the crowd like a blade.

"The truth is in the weight," he whispered, his voice carrying. "Not the word. Not the ledger. Not the numbers. The weight. The choices you make. The weight you carry. The scales you tip. That's the truth. That's what matters. That's what counts."

He looked at Taman, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "The ledgers lie. The numbers lie. The words lie. But the weight? The weight never lies. The weight always tells the truth. And the truth is heavy. The truth is hard. The truth is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. The truth was in the weight, not the word, not the ledger, not the numbers. And the weight was heavy. The weight was hard. The weight was what they carried, what they bore, what they tipped. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

That night, Taman dreamed of the eastern fort's open sky, of the painted signs of welcome, of the healthy animals and laughing children, of the air clear of ash, of the sense of rightness, of equilibrium, of weight shared fairly.

He dreamed of balance, of scales level, of choices that didn't break things, of people working together instead of against each other. He dreamed of Sela safe, of Boone free, of his mother whole, of a life where weight was shared, where scales were balanced, where they could live whole.

But he woke to the walls of Fort Shadow pressing close, to the palisade walls leaning inward, to the weight pressing down, to the scales tipping, to the chains binding tighter, to the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change everything.

The eastern fort felt like a dream, like something that had never been real, like a promise that had slipped away before it had ever been his.

The walls pressed close, and the weight pressed down, and the scales shifted, and the chains tightened, and Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away.

The truth was in the weight. Not the word. Not the ledger. Not the numbers. The weight. And the weight was heavy. And the weight was hard. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The hawk's cry split the morning, sharp as a ledger line, cutting through the air like a blade, like a warning, like a promise of things to come.

The fort stirred uneasy, the people waking to the sound, their eyes wide, their expressions troubled, feeling the weight pressing down, sensing the scales shifting, knowing that something was building, something was changing, something was coming.

And when it came, they would all be caught in it.

All of them.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 18

Their mother stepped into the trading square the next morning, her movements steady, her expression firm, her voice clear as she spoke against Arpin, naming his rule cruelty in front of all.

The crowd gathered quickly, drawn by the sound of her voice, by the boldness of her words, by the sight of someone speaking truth to power, of someone naming the cruelty for what it was.

"Your ledgers are chains," she said, her voice carrying. "Your debts are bindings. Your kindness is credit, and your credit is a cage. You measure out kindness like coins, and every coin comes with a price, and every price creates a debt, and every debt binds tighter, until no one can move, until no one can breathe, until no one can escape."

She looked at Arpin directly, her eyes steady, her expression unwavering. "That's not trade. That's not fairness. That's not balance. That's cruelty. That's control. That's tyranny. And you know it. You've always known it. You've always meant it to be this way."

Arpin's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing, his hands clenching at his sides. He stepped down from his platform, his movements sharp, deliberate, dangerous.

"You speak against me," he said, his voice cold, hard. "You speak against the ledger. You speak against the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe. You speak against order, against balance, against the way things should be."

He stepped closer, his presence large, threatening, and the crowd shifted, uneasy, sensing something building, something dangerous, something that would break.

"And when you speak against order," Arpin continued, his voice rising, "when you speak against balance, when you speak against me, you speak against yourself. You speak against the system that protects you. And that has consequences. That has a price. And that price must be paid."

He struck her then, his hand hard against her face, the sound sharp, brutal, cutting through the air like a whip.

The crowd gasped, their voices rising, their expressions shifting from curiosity to shock to anger. Someone cried out. Someone stepped forward. Someone moved to help.

But Arpin struck her again, harder this time, his blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, until she staggered, until she fell, until she hit the dirt hard, her body crumpling, her face bloodied, her voice silenced.

The crowd surged forward then, their anger rising, their voices shouting, their hands reaching, their will to help, to protect, to stand against the cruelty, to stop the violence.

But Isaac stepped forward then, his hand in his pocket, his thumb working the coin, the brass warming under his touch, catching the light like fire.

He rubbed the coin in his pocket, his movements deliberate, his expression calm, and the crowd felt something shift, felt something press down, felt something squeeze.

The anger ebbed, their voices fading, their hands falling, their will weakening, their courage failing. The coin worked its magic, its power wrapping around them like chains, like bindings, like a weight that pressed down until resistance felt impossible, until help felt foolish, until standing against felt like suicide.

The crowd fell silent, their anger turning into uneasy silence, their courage turning into fear, their will to help turning into self-preservation.

Taman lunged forward then, rage hot in his throat, his hands clenched, his body moving before his mind could stop it, before he could think, before he could reason.

He would stop Arpin. He would protect his mother. He would end the violence, the cruelty, the tyranny. He would make Arpin pay, would make him suffer, would make him bleed.

But Sela's arms clamped around him before he could reach Arpin, before he could do anything, before he could make things worse.

"Don't," she said, her voice urgent, her grip tight. "Don't, Taman. Don't. If you do this, if you attack him, they'll kill you. They'll lock you away. They'll break you. And that won't help Mother. That won't change anything. That will only make things worse."

Taman struggled against her grip, his rage hot, his will strong, his body fighting, his mind screaming to break free, to act, to do something, anything, to stop the violence, to protect his mother, to make Arpin pay.

But Sela held him tight, her strength surprising, her will stronger, her voice steady. "Don't, Taman. Don't. We have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to wait. And when the time comes, when we can act, we will. But not now. Not like this. Not when it will only make things worse."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt something crack, felt his rage turn into something else—shame, helplessness, the bitter knowledge that he was powerless, that he couldn't help his mother, that he couldn't stop the violence, that he could only watch, only stand by, only let it happen.

Boone stood rooted in place, his expression pale, his body still, his ledger tucked under his arm like a shield he couldn't drop, like a weapon he couldn't use, like a burden he couldn't bear.

He watched Arpin strike their mother, watched the blows fall, watched her stagger, watched her fall, watched her hit the dirt, bloodied and broken.

And he did nothing.

He stood frozen, his body locked, his will paralyzed, his courage failed. He wanted to help, wanted to protect, wanted to stand against the cruelty, wanted to make Arpin pay. But his legs wouldn't move. His voice wouldn't work. His will wouldn't obey.

The ledger felt heavy in his arms, its pages pressing against his side, its numbers running through his mind, its debts and obligations weighing him down, binding him, paralyzing him.

Numbers don't lie, he'd said. Numbers show you where you stand, what you owe, what's owed to you. And he stood in debt, stood obligated, stood bound. And that debt, that obligation, that binding—it held him still, it kept him silent, it made him powerless.

He could do nothing. He would do nothing. He was bound, obligated, paralyzed by the very system he'd believed in, by the very numbers he'd trusted, by the very ledgers he'd thought would free him.

Arpin stood over their mother then, his expression cold, dangerous, his voice hard, cruel.

"Next time, woman," he growled, his words sharp, cutting. "Next time you speak against me, next time you name my rule cruelty, next time you challenge my control, I'll take more than blood. A debt's a debt, and your flesh will pay. Your family's flesh will pay. Every word, every challenge, every act of defiance—it all creates a debt. And every debt must be paid. And if you can't pay in coin, you pay in flesh. That's how it works. That's how it's always worked. And that's how it always will."

He stepped back, his movements sharp, deliberate, and the crowd shifted, uneasy, their fear growing, their will weakening, their courage failing.

The missionary moved forward then, his movements jerky, unsteady, his expression troubled, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of broken scripture and twisted words.

He knelt beside their mother's prone form, his gaunt frame hunched, his hands shaking, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"The wages of sin," he muttered, his voice carrying. "The wages of sin is death. The wages of sin is weight. The wages of sin is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. Every sin, every choice, every weight—it all creates a debt. And every debt must be paid. And the wages of sin is weight."

He looked up, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "But weight is not death. Weight is not punishment. Weight is consequence. Weight is choice. Weight is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. The missionary's words were twisted, broken, but they rang with a truth that made his chest ache—the wages of sin is weight. Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all created weight. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

They carried their mother home that evening, her body bruised and broken, her face bloodied, her spirit wounded but not broken. She was hurt, but she was alive. She was beaten, but she was not defeated. She was wounded, but she would heal.

But the weight of what had happened pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what Arpin could do, of what Isaac's coin could make people accept, of what happened when you spoke truth to power, when you named cruelty for what it was, when you challenged control.

That night, a tremor split a crock of water in their hut, the sound sharp and sudden, cutting through the silence like a knife.

The crock cracked, water spilling across the floor, pooling in the dirt, reflecting the dim light of the lantern, showing fractured images, broken reflections, pieces of things that didn't quite fit together.

Taman watched the water spread, felt the ground shake beneath his feet, heard the mountain groan in the distance, sensed the scales shifting, the weight building, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change everything.

He felt the scales groaning beneath his feet, felt the weight pressing down, felt the ground tremble, felt the mountain respond to the violence, to the cruelty, to the weight that had been added, to the scales that had been tipped.

Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all created weight. And every weight shifted the scales. And every shift brought the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

The wages of sin is weight. And the weight was heavy. And the weight was hard. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Taman stood in the dark, clutching his pouch, feeling the weight of it, the texture of it, the reminder of what he carried, of what he bore, of what he tipped.

His mother was hurt, but she was alive. She was beaten, but she was not defeated. She was wounded, but she would heal.

But the weight remained. The scales groaned. The mountain waited. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 19

Boone began to waver in the days that followed, haunted by the memory of his mother in the dirt, her face bloodied, her body broken, her bruises blooming purple beneath her skin.

He'd stood frozen, paralyzed, unable to move, unable to help, unable to do anything but watch as Arpin struck her, as the blows fell, as she staggered and fell, as the crowd cheered, as Isaac's coin worked its magic, turning anger into acceptance, courage into fear.

He'd done nothing. He'd said nothing. He'd stood by and watched, bound by debt, obligated by ledger, paralyzed by the very system he'd believed in, by the very numbers he'd trusted.

And the weight of that inaction, that cowardice, that failure—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd failed to be, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over doing what was right.

Isaac caught his hesitation that morning, his movements smooth, his words careful, his hand working the coin in his pocket, the brass warming under his thumb, catching the light like fire.

"You're troubled," Isaac said, his voice smooth as oil, his words wrapping around Boone like chains, like bindings, like promises that felt real, that felt right. "I can see it. You're questioning things. You're doubting. You're wondering if you made the right choice, if you did the right thing, if standing by was the right move."

Boone's expression shifted, his eyes wary, and Isaac felt something change in the air, felt the weight shift, felt the scales tip.

"But you did the right thing," Isaac continued, his voice low, persuasive, the coin in his pocket shifting in rhythm with his words. "You stayed. You played the game. You survived. And that's what matters. That's what keeps you alive. That's what keeps your family alive. Survival isn't cowardice. Survival is smart. Survival is necessary. And you survived. That's what matters."

His voice dropped to a whisper, and Boone felt something shift, felt the weight press down, felt the scales tip. "Your mother challenged Arpin. She spoke against him. She named his rule cruelty. And she paid the price. But you? You stayed. You survived. You lived to see another day. And that's what matters. That's what keeps you alive. That's what keeps your family alive. Survival is what matters."

Boone felt something sink in his chest, felt doubt fading, felt the weight of Isaac's words pressing down. Survival was what mattered. Staying was smart. Playing the game was necessary. And he'd survived. He'd stayed. He'd played the game. That's what mattered.

But the memory of his mother in the dirt, bloodied and broken—it lingered, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over doing what was right.

Sela found him later that day, her expression troubled, her eyes seeing something that made her voice careful.

"Family outweighs ledgers," she said, her words soft, measured. "Blood outweighs debt. Love outweighs obligation. And what happened to Mother—it was wrong. It was cruel. It was tyranny. And standing by while it happened—that was wrong too. That was cowardice. That was failure."

Boone's expression shifted, his eyes troubled, and Sela felt something change in the air, felt the weight shift, felt the scales tip.

"But I couldn't help," Boone said, his voice tight. "I wanted to. I tried to. But my legs wouldn't move. My voice wouldn't work. My will wouldn't obey. The ledger held me. The debt held me. The obligation held me. And I couldn't break free. I couldn't help. I couldn't do anything but watch."

Sela's expression softened. "The ledger didn't hold you, Boone. The debt didn't hold you. The obligation didn't hold you. Fear held you. Cowardice held you. The weight of choosing survival over courage held you. And that's a weight you'll carry. That's a debt you'll pay. That's a choice you'll have to live with."

Boone felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the weight of Sela's words pressing down. She was right. The ledger hadn't held him. Fear had held him. Cowardice had held him. And that was a weight he'd carry, a debt he'd pay, a choice he'd have to live with.

But his silence cut deeper than refusal, deeper than words, deeper than anything Sela could say. He'd chosen. He'd chosen survival over courage, ledger over family, fear over love. And that choice, that silence, that failure—it was his. It was what he'd chosen. It was what he'd be.

The missionary muttered in the yard that afternoon, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"Names weigh more than numbers," he whispered, his voice carrying, though no one knew who he was speaking to. "Names carry weight. Names carry truth. Names carry meaning. And when you name something, when you call it what it is, you give it weight. You give it truth. You give it meaning. And that weight, that truth, that meaning—it matters. It counts. It tips scales."

He looked at Boone, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "Numbers lie. Ledgers lie. Debts lie. But names? Names never lie. Names tell the truth. Names show what you are, what you've chosen, what you've become. And sooner or later, names will tell. Sooner or later, truth will show."

Boone felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. Names weighed more than numbers. Names carried truth. Names showed what you were, what you'd chosen, what you'd become. And his name, his choices, his failures—they showed. They told. They weighed.

Taman tried to lead his family toward the east again that evening, his movements urgent, his voice tight with desperation.

"We have to go," he said, his words tumbling over each other. "We have to leave. We have to escape. The supply route is here. The way is clear. We can go east, find balance, share weight, live whole. We can escape Arpin, escape the ledgers, escape the debt, escape the chains. We can be free. We can be whole."

But guards turned them back at the gate, their expressions cold, their voices hard, their hands on their weapons.

"Orders," one guard said, his voice sharp. "No one leaves. Not until debts are cleared. Not until ledgers are balanced. Not until Arpin says so. And Arpin says no one leaves."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away again. They were trapped. They were bound. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't see, couldn't escape.

The crowd saw and whispered, their voices carrying, their words sharp, their eyes watching, their expressions shifting from curiosity to judgment to ridicule.

"Trying to leave," someone said. "Trying to escape. Trying to break free. But you can't break free. Not while you're in debt. Not while you're in the ledger. Not while Arpin owns you."

Arpin grinned then, his expression satisfied, dangerous, letting humiliation work where fists did not.

"Want to leave?" he called out, his voice carrying. "Want to escape? Want to break free? Then clear your debt. Balance your ledger. Pay what you owe. And once you've paid, once you're free, you can go. But until then? Until then, you're mine. You're bound. You're obligated. And there's no escaping that. There's no breaking free. There's no way out."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the weight of Arpin's words pressing down. They were trapped. They were bound. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

That night, Boone dreamed of his mother's blood in the dirt, her face bloodied, her body broken, her bruises blooming purple, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his failure, for his cowardice, for his silence.

He dreamed of standing frozen, paralyzed, unable to move, unable to help, unable to do anything but watch, bound by debt, obligated by ledger, paralyzed by fear, by cowardice, by the weight of choosing survival over courage.

He woke gasping, his body shaking, his heart racing, the memory of the dream vivid, real, heavy, a weight that pressed down, a debt that he'd pay, a choice that he'd made, a failure that was his.

He whispered to Taman in the dark, his voice tight, troubled, his words careful.

"Maybe," he said, his voice low. "Maybe we should try again. Maybe we should leave. Maybe we should escape. Maybe we should break free. Maybe we should choose courage over survival, family over ledger, love over fear."

But his words were halting, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something shift, felt hope fading, felt the weight of Boone's hesitation pressing down.

"But not yet," Boone continued, his voice weaker. "Not yet. Not when it's so dangerous. Not when Arpin's grip is so tight. Not when Isaac's coin is so strong. We have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to wait for the right moment. And when it comes, when we can act, we will. But not yet. Not yet."

Taman felt something sink in his chest, felt hope fading, felt the east slipping away again. Boone wanted to leave, wanted to escape, wanted to break free. But not yet. Not yet. And "not yet" was beginning to feel like "never," like "impossible," like a promise that would never be kept, like hope that would never be realized.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Supplies dwindled in the days that followed, the food running low, the tools wearing thin, the resources that had once been shared now hoarded, controlled, rationed by Arpin's ledger, bound by his debt, obligated by his terms.

The people grumbled but did not resist, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes watching, their fear growing, their will weakening, their courage failing.

They were bound. They were obligated. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of. And resistance felt impossible. Rebellion felt like suicide. Standing against felt like standing against a mountain, like trying to stop the earth from turning, like trying to fight the weight itself.

Isaac rubbed his coin so often that even children noticed, whispering that he had luck in his pocket, that the brass piece he carried brought him power, that it gave him the ability to bend wills, to twist truth, to make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

They didn't understand what the coin really was, what it really did, what it really meant. They just saw the power, saw the control, saw the way it bent people to Isaac's will, to Arpin's terms, to the ledger's demands.

And they whispered about it, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes watching, their fear growing, their understanding dawning—slowly, gradually, like the sun rising over the mountain, like the weight building, like the scales tipping.

Boone found Taman that morning, his expression troubled, his voice careful, his words halting, fragile.

"I think," he said, his voice low. "I think Arpin must be stopped. I think he's gone too far. I think his grip is too tight, his control too strong, his cruelty too much. I think we have to do something. I think we have to stand against him. I think we have to break free."

But his words were halting, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something shift, felt hope fading, felt the weight of Boone's hesitation pressing down. Boone wanted to act, wanted to stand against, wanted to break free. But his words were weak, his will was uncertain, his courage was fragile.

"Blood's heavier than ink," Taman said, his voice tight. "Family's heavier than ledger. Love's heavier than debt. And if we don't stand against Arpin, if we don't break free, if we don't choose courage over survival, then we're complicit. We're part of the problem. We're part of the cruelty, the tyranny, the weight that's crushing everyone."

Boone nodded, his expression troubled, but his silence was heavy, weighted, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Boone wanted to act, wanted to stand against, wanted to break free. But wanting and doing were different things. And Boone's wanting felt weak, felt uncertain, felt like hope that would never be realized.

The missionary staggered into the square that afternoon, his eyes wild, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"The mountain is listening," he shouted, his voice carrying. "The mountain is watching. The mountain is responding to the weight, to the scales, to the choices that are being made. Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all adds weight. It all shifts scales. It all brings the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that will break, that will change, that will end everything."

He stopped, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "The mountain is listening. Can't you hear it? Can't you feel it? Can't you sense it groaning, shifting, responding to the weight, to the cruelty, to the tyranny? The mountain is alive, and it's angry, and it's responding to what you're doing, to the weight you're adding, to the scales you're tipping."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. The missionary's words were wild, mad, but they rang with a truth that made his chest ache. The mountain was listening. The mountain was responding. The mountain was groaning, shifting, building toward something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

Another tremor shook the fort then, stronger than any yet, sending shingles skittering down roofs, rattling walls, shaking the ground beneath their feet.

The tremor lasted longer than the ones before, and when it stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous, weighted with warning.

Animals panicked in their pens, their cries rising, their movements frantic, their fear growing, their understanding dawning—something was building, something was changing, something was coming.

A sickened mule dropped dead mid-bray, its body collapsing, its tongue swollen, its eyes clouded, its death quick and ugly, a reminder of the weight, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

Sela knelt beside the animal, her hands steady, her expression troubled, her weight shimmering faintly, barely visible, a sign of her gift, of her ability to hold weight, to steady it, to keep it from breaking others.

But the animal did not rise. It did not breathe. It did not move. Her gift could hold weight, but it could not bring back the dead, could not reverse what had been done, could not undo the weight that had been added, the scales that had been tipped, the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The earth groaned then, a deep, rumbling sound that came from beneath them, from the mountain itself, from the weight that had been building, from the scales that had been tipping, from the something that was gathering, that was preparing, that was coming.

And the people of Fort Shadow hushed, their voices falling silent, their movements stilling, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if for the first time they too could hear what Taman heard, could feel what he felt, could sense what he sensed—the mountain groaning, the weight building, the scales shifting, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

They had ignored the tremors, dismissed the warnings, laughed off the missionary's words. But this was different. This was real. This was immediate. This was the mountain itself groaning, shifting, responding to the weight, to the cruelty, to the tyranny.

And they heard it. They felt it. They sensed it. And they knew, with a certainty that made their chests tight, that something was building, something was changing, something was coming.

Something that would break. Something that would change. Something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 21

Boone could not sleep that night, haunted by the memory of his mother in the dirt, her face bloodied, her body broken, her bruises blooming purple beneath her skin, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his failure, for his cowardice, for his silence.

He'd stood frozen, paralyzed, unable to move, unable to help, unable to do anything but watch, bound by debt, obligated by ledger, paralyzed by fear, by cowardice, by the weight of choosing survival over courage.

And the weight of that inaction, that cowardice, that failure—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd failed to do, of what he'd failed to be, of what he'd chosen over courage, over family, over doing what was right.

He confessed to Taman in the dark, his voice tight, troubled, his words careful, halting.

"I think," he said, his voice low. "I think Arpin may have gone too far. I think what he did to Mother—it was wrong. It was cruel. It was too much. I think he's gone too far, and I think something needs to be done. I think he needs to be stopped."

But fear still knotted his tongue, still held him back, still kept him from acting, from standing against, from doing what was right.

"I wanted to help," he continued, his voice weaker. "I wanted to protect her. I wanted to make Arpin pay. But I couldn't. My legs wouldn't move. My voice wouldn't work. My will wouldn't obey. The ledger held me. The debt held me. The obligation held me. And I couldn't break free."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest. Boone was fracturing, breaking, the weight of his cowardice pressing down, the debt of his silence accumulating, the obligation of his failure building.

"Blood's heavier than ink," Taman said, his voice tight. "Family's heavier than ledger. Love's heavier than debt. And if we don't stand against Arpin, if we don't break free, if we don't choose courage over survival, then we're complicit. We're part of the problem."

But Boone's silence was heavy, weighted, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Boone wanted to act, wanted to stand against, wanted to break free. But wanting and doing were different things.

Sela urged them to leave for the east that morning, her movements urgent, her voice tight with desperation.

"We have to go," she said. "We have to leave. We have to escape. The east fort waits. Balance waits. Weight shared waits. We can go there, find balance, share weight, live whole. We can escape Arpin, escape the ledgers, escape the debt."

But Isaac was already whispering to Arpin about "traitors" in their midst, about people talking of leaving, about whispers of escape, about plans to break free.

Arpin's gaze sharpened, his expression dangerous, his voice hard. "Find them," he said. "Find who's talking. Find who's planning. Find who's trying to leave. And when you find them, bring them to me. I'll show them what happens when traitors try to escape."

Boone drifted through the fort like a ghost that day, his ledger tucked under his arm like a shield he couldn't drop, his eyes vacant, his movements mechanical, listening to the numbers instead of his conscience, reading the ledger instead of the truth, seeing the debt instead of the cost.

The missionary appeared at Boone's shoulder that afternoon, his movements jerky, his voice low, his words careful.

"Names weigh more than debts," he muttered, his words startling Boone. "Names carry weight. Names carry truth. Names show what you are, what you've chosen, what you've become. And your name, your choices, your failures—they show. They tell. They weigh."

Boone felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift. Names weighed more than debts. Names showed what you were, what you'd chosen, what you'd become. And his name, his choices, his failures—they showed. They told. They weighed.

A hawk's cry sliced through the dawn the next morning, sharper than a blade, cutting through the air like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

Boone startled like he'd been struck, his body shaking, his eyes wide, his expression frightened, as if the hawk's cry was a judgment on him, on his cowardice, on his failure.

For the first time, Boone looked at Arpin with doubt instead of awe, his eyes seeing the cruelty for what it was, the tyranny for what it meant, the weight for what it cost.

The ledger was heavy in his hands. The debt was heavy in his chest. The obligation was heavy in his soul. And maybe, just maybe, blood was heavier than ink. Maybe family was heavier than ledger. Maybe love was heavier than debt.

Maybe it was time to choose courage over survival. Maybe it was time to stand against instead of standing by. Maybe it was time to break free instead of staying bound.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 22

Arpin gathered the fort that morning, his voice rising over the crowd like a command, like a threat, like a promise of things to come, railing about betrayal and weakness, his words hot enough to sear, his anger building, his control tightening.

"Someone is moving against me," he shouted, his voice carrying. "Someone is challenging my control. Someone is trying to escape, to break free, to undermine the ledger, to destroy the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe."

He singled Boone out then, his eyes sharp, his expression dangerous, his voice hard. "You," he said, his words cutting. "You've been talking. You've been questioning. You've been doubting. You've been considering escape, betrayal, treason. And that has consequences. That has a price. And that price must be paid."

Boone felt something sink in his chest, felt the weight press down, felt the scales tip. Arpin knew. Isaac had told him. The coin had seen, had heard, had known. And now Boone would pay.

"Confess," Arpin demanded, his voice hard. "Confess your divided loyalties. Confess your doubts. Confess your plans. Confess your betrayal. Confess it all. Confess it before everyone, before the ledger, before the weight that holds you, that binds you, that owns you."

Boone stammered, his voice weak, his words careful, his will failing. He wanted to lie, wanted to deny, wanted to protect himself, his family, his future. But he couldn't lie. Not in front of everyone. Not in front of Arpin. Not when Isaac's coin was working, when the weight was pressing down, when the truth was demanding to be told.

"I—" he began, his voice shaking. "I thought—I considered—I wondered—"

But his words fell flat, hollow even in his own ears, and the silence that followed was punishment enough—heavy, weighted, a judgment on his cowardice, his failure, his betrayal.

Arpin smiled, his expression satisfied, dangerous. "You see?" he said, his voice carrying. "He can't lie. He can't deny. He can't escape the truth. The ledger holds him. The debt holds him. The obligation holds him. And he confesses. He admits. He pays."

He exacted his toll not in blood, but in humiliation, his voice hard, cruel. "You will serve as my public clerk," he announced. "You will write debts and punishments. You will record every choice, every weight, every scale tipped. You will write under your mother's bruised eye, under the weight of your own failure, under the judgment of everyone who sees you, who knows you, who knows what you are, what you've chosen, what you've become."

Boone felt something break in his chest, felt shame rising, felt the weight of his humiliation pressing down. He would serve Arpin publicly, write his debts, record his punishments, under his mother's bruised eye, under the weight of his own failure, under everyone's judgment.

Isaac rubbed his coin then, and the people cheered the spectacle, their voices rising, their applause loud, forgetting their own chains, their own debts, their own bindings, caught in the spectacle, the judgment, the weight of seeing someone else pay, someone else suffer, someone else bear the burden of betrayal, of failure, of cowardice.

Taman burned with shame, vowing Boone would not be left in chains forever, would not be left to serve Arpin, would not be left to write debts and punishments under their mother's bruised eye, would not be left to bear the weight of humiliation, of failure, of cowardice.

The missionary cackled softly, his voice rising, his words tumbling. "Pound of flesh, pound of ink," he muttered. "Every debt paid in flesh. Every obligation recorded in ink. Every weight written down, measured out, calculated. Pound of flesh, pound of ink. And it all adds up. It all accumulates. It all brings the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that will break, that will change, that will end everything."

That night, a wolf was found dead inside the fort walls, no wounds upon it but foam on its lips, its body still, its eyes clouded, its death quick and ugly, a reminder of the weight, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 23

Word came from the east that morning, spreading through the fort like wildfire, like hope, like a promise of things to come—cavalry may ride, men ready to break Arpin's hold, soldiers coming to free them, to share weight, to balance scales, to end the tyranny, the cruelty, the binding.

The fort buzzed with hope, voices rising, words spreading, eyes brightening, spirits lifting, as if help was coming, as if rescue was on the way, as if freedom was possible, as if balance was within reach.

Taman seized on it, telling Sela this may be their chance, this may be the way out, this may be the rescue they'd been waiting for, the help they'd been hoping for, the freedom they'd been dreaming of.

"Maybe," he said, his voice urgent. "Maybe this is it. Maybe the cavalry will come. Maybe they'll break Arpin's hold. Maybe they'll free us. Maybe they'll share weight, balance scales, end the tyranny. Maybe this is our chance. Maybe this is our way out."

But Arpin played it smooth, welcoming the rumor, smiling wide, his expression calm, reasonable, as if the cavalry was welcome, as if their arrival was expected, as if their help was needed, wanted, appreciated.

"Let them come," he said, his voice carrying. "Let them ride. Let them see the fort, the ledger, the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe. Let them see the order, the balance, the way things should be. And if they're reasonable, if they understand, they'll see. They'll understand. They'll join. They'll help."

But behind closed doors, he prepared gold and promises, working with Isaac, planning, plotting, preparing to turn soldiers into mercenaries, to buy loyalty, to bind help with debt, to make allies into weapons, weight bending even men in uniform.

"If they come," Arpin said, his voice low. "If they ride. If they try to help. We'll meet them. We'll talk. We'll negotiate. And if gold doesn't work, if promises don't work, if debt doesn't work, then Isaac's coin will work. It always works. It bends wills. It twists truth. It makes people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And soldiers are people. They bend. They twist. They agree. They join."

Boone wrote the terms, sick with shame, his hand moving the ink, his words recording the plans, the promises, the debts that would bind the soldiers, that would turn help into weapons, that would make allies into enemies.

He couldn't stop his hand from moving the ink, couldn't stop the words from forming, couldn't stop the debt from being recorded, couldn't stop the binding from being created. He was bound. He was obligated. He was caught in chains he couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

The missionary wandered the barracks that evening, muttering of armies that march in circles, always back to the beginning, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the hope, the promise of rescue.

"Armies march in circles," he muttered. "Always back to the beginning. Always back to where they started. Always back to the weight, to the scales, to the choices that brought them here, that bound them, that owned them. Armies can't break weight. Armies can't balance scales. Armies can't free what's bound. They just add weight. They just shift scales. They just bind tighter."

The hawk perched on the wall, watching the drills, the preparations, the movements of men getting ready, preparing for what was coming, what was building, what was gathering.

The bird watched, its eyes sharp, intelligent, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if judging the men, their preparations, their plans, their choices, their weight, their scales, their something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change.

Taman felt the ground tremor again, the rhythm of drums beneath the soil, the mountain groaning, shifting, responding to the weight, to the choices, to the something that was building, that was gathering, that was coming.

The cavalry rumor spread, hope growing, voices rising, spirits lifting. But the weight remained. The scales shifted. The mountain groaned. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 24
---

The cavalry arrived not as liberators but as Arpin's newest weapon, bought and bound by his silver tongue and Isaac's coin, their flags flying under Arpin's banner, their loyalty secured by gold and promise and debt and obligation.

The people cheered their arrival at first, their voices rising, their hope growing, their spirits lifting, as if rescue was here, as if help had arrived, as if freedom was possible.

But then they saw whose flag the soldiers marched under, whose banner they flew, whose orders they followed, and the hope faded, the voices fell silent, the spirits sank, as if rescue had turned into more of the same, as if help had become another weapon, as if freedom was farther away than ever.

The soldiers drank and laughed in Arpin's hall that evening, their voices loud, their movements free, their loyalty bought, their will bent, their choices made, their weight added to Arpin's ledger, their scales tipped in his favor.

Boone watched them, bile rising in his throat, his stomach turning, his will failing, seeing the soldiers who should have been liberators, should have been help, should have been freedom, become weapons, become tools, become more chains, more bindings, more weight.

He'd written the terms, recorded the debts, created the bindings that had turned soldiers into mercenaries, that had bought loyalty, that had made allies into enemies. And the weight of that choice, that debt, that binding—it pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd created, what he'd become.

Taman whispered to Sela that balance was tilting past saving, that the scales were tipping too far, that the weight was building too fast, that the mountain was groaning too loud, that something was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

But Sela still clung to hope, her voice soft, her words careful, her expression steady. "Maybe," she said. "Maybe there's still a way. Maybe there's still hope. Maybe we can still find balance, share weight, live whole. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe we can still save this. Maybe we can still find a way."

But her hope felt weak, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Maybe wasn't enough. Hope wasn't enough. Clinging wasn't enough. The scales were tipping too far. The weight was building too fast. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Arpin paraded through the square with the soldiers at his back that afternoon, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, daring anyone to speak against him, to challenge his control, to resist his rule.

"Look," he said, his voice carrying. "Look at what we have. Look at the soldiers. Look at the order. Look at the balance. Look at the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe. And who would challenge that? Who would resist that? Who would stand against that? No one. Because everyone sees. Everyone understands. Everyone knows that order is better than chaos, that control is better than freedom, that safety is better than risk."

The missionary shuffled past, laughing like he'd heard the joke of it long before, his voice rising, his words tumbling, his warnings lost in the noise, the spectacle, the weight of seeing soldiers who should have been help become weapons.

"Heard this before," the missionary muttered. "Seen this before. Soldiers marching. Flags flying. Promises made. Debt secured. Weight added. Scales tipped. And it always ends the same. Always ends with more weight, more binding, more chains. Always ends with the mountain groaning louder, the scales tipping further, the something building faster, closer to breaking, closer to changing, closer to ending everything."

A tremor shook loose stones from the wall that evening, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come.

The hawk wheeled in the sky, circling tighter, its cry sharp, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Taman felt the mountain groaning like it too had soldiers within its chest, like the weight of the mercenaries, the bindings, the choices, was pressing down on it, was building inside it, was gathering, preparing, coming.

The cavalry had arrived, but they were not liberators. They were weapons. They were tools. They were more chains, more bindings, more weight. And the scales were tipping too far. The weight was building too fast. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 25

Animals fell sick in the pens that morning, their tongues swelling, their eyes clouding, their deaths quick and ugly, a reminder of the weight, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The sickness spread quickly, moving from animal to animal, pen to pen, the death quick, the suffering brief but intense, the bodies piling up, the stench growing, the weight accumulating, the scales tipping further.

Arpin blamed Sela, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, shouting that her weight poisons the fort, that her gift corrupts the animals, that her burden brings sickness, that she must be removed, must be eliminated, must be destroyed.

"She carries weight," he shouted, his voice carrying. "Too much weight. More weight than any one person should carry. More weight than the fort can bear. And that weight poisons everything. It corrupts the animals. It brings sickness. It spreads rot. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then it will poison us all. It will corrupt us all. It will rot us all."

Isaac rubbed his coin, and the people nodded, some too afraid to question, others too eager to believe, their minds bending, their wills twisting, their understanding shifting, as if Sela really was the problem, as if her weight really was the poison, as if her gift really was the corruption, as if removing her would fix everything, would balance the scales, would share the weight.

Boone protested softly, his voice weak, his words careful, his will failing, saying that Sela wasn't the problem, that her gift wasn't poison, that her weight wasn't corruption, that blaming her was wrong, was cruel, was a lie.

But Arpin silenced him with a glance sharper than a blade, his eyes cold, dangerous, his expression warning, threatening, as if Boone's protest was treason, was betrayal, was something that would be punished, would be paid for, would be recorded in the ledger, would be added to his debt.

The missionary knelt by a dead calf that afternoon, his movements jerky, his voice low, his words careful, whispering "even beasts bear weight," his words chilling the mothers nearby, their voices falling silent, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if the weight was real, was immediate, was something they could feel, could see, could understand.

"Even beasts bear weight," the missionary muttered. "Even animals feel the scales tipping. Even creatures sense the mountain groaning. And when weight builds too fast, when scales tip too far, when the mountain groans too loud, even beasts die. Even animals suffer. Even creatures bear the cost. And the cost is heavy. The cost is real. The cost is paid in death, in sickness, in rot."

The hawk drifted overhead but did not cry, as if waiting, watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, patient, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Sela clung to her mother that evening, her body shaking, her voice trembling, her expression frightened, as if she really was the problem, really was the poison, really was the corruption, as if removing her would fix everything, would balance the scales, would share the weight.

But her mother insisted the sickness was no girl's fault, that Sela's gift wasn't poison, that her weight wasn't corruption, that blaming her was wrong, was cruel, was a lie. But her voice trembled, her words were weak, her will was failing, and Taman felt something sink in his chest.

The sickness was real. The animals were dying. The weight was building. And blaming Sela was wrong, was cruel, was a lie. But the people believed. The coin made them believe. And belief was weight. Belief shifted scales. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

That night, ash fell on the fort though no fire burned, dusting roofs and skin like a funeral shroud, the flakes drifting down like snow, like warning, like judgment, settling on everything, covering everything, marking everything with weight, with scale, with the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The ash fell without fire, without smoke, without source, as if the mountain itself was exhaling, was responding, was preparing, as if the weight was building, the scales were tipping, the something was gathering, preparing, coming.

Taman watched the ash fall, felt it settle on his skin, tasted it in his mouth, saw it cover everything, mark everything, weight everything, and he felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away.

The sickness was real. The animals were dying. The ash was falling. The weight was building. The scales were tipping. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 26

Fort Shadow grew tense in the days that followed, whispers about Sela's weight spreading like wildfire, like poison, like rot, moving from person to person, voice to voice, mind to mind, the words growing, the fear spreading, the weight accumulating, the scales tipping further.

"Sela's weight poisons the fort," the whispers said. "Her gift corrupts the animals. Her burden brings sickness. Her weight shifts scales. Her gift tips balance. Her burden breaks things. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then it will poison us all. It will corrupt us all. It will break us all."

Arpin fanned the flames, holding court in the square, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, saying the mountain's anger is her fault, the tremors are her fault, the sickness is her fault, the rot is her fault, the weight is her fault, the scales tipping is her fault.

"She carries too much weight," he shouted. "More weight than any one person should carry. More weight than the fort can bear. And that weight poisons everything. It corrupts the animals. It brings sickness. It shifts scales. It tips balance. It breaks things. And the mountain responds. The mountain groans. The mountain shakes. The mountain erupts. And it's all her fault. It's all because of her weight. It's all because of her gift. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then the mountain will keep groaning, keep shaking, keep erupting, until it breaks everything, until it destroys everything, until it ends everything."

At night, men broke into Taman's cabin, their movements quick, their voices low, their hands rough, seizing Mother while Sela fled into the dark, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real.

Boone watched but did nothing, torn between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, his body still, his voice silent, his will paralyzed, caught between two weights, two debts, two obligations, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen.

They dragged Mother into the square, her body struggling, her voice rising, her fear sharp, immediate, real, and Arpin paraded her before the town, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, saying he will "root out the curse," he will "eliminate the poison," he will "destroy the weight that poisons everything, corrupts everything, breaks everything."

"This is proof," he shouted. "This is evidence. This is what happens when weight builds too fast, when scales tip too far, when the mountain groans too loud. And I will root it out. I will eliminate it. I will destroy it. I will save you all. I will protect you all. I will ensure you all."

Taman tried to rally help, his movements urgent, his voice desperate, his words pleading, begging people to help, to protect, to stand against the cruelty, to stop the violence, to save his mother, to save Sela, to save them all.

But the townsfolk averted their eyes, their movements turning away, their voices falling silent, their wills failing, caught in fear, in debt, in obligation, unable to help, unable to protect, unable to stand against, caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

The missionary muttered of lambs led to slaughter, his voice low, his words careful, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the weight, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more weight, more debt, more obligation.

Taman realized only he knew where Sela had hidden—a burden already bending him, a weight already pressing down, a debt already accumulating, an obligation already building, a choice already made, a path already chosen, a weight that would break him, a debt that would cost him, an obligation that would destroy him.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Arpin interrogated Taman publicly the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, demanding Sela's whereabouts, her hiding place, her location, her secret, her burden, her weight.

"Where is she?" he shouted. "Where has she hidden? Where is the weight that poisons everything, corrupts everything, breaks everything? Where is the gift that shifts scales, tips balance, breaks things? Tell me. Tell me now. Tell me before it's too late, before the mountain breaks, before everything ends."

Isaac whispered in his ear, stroking his coin, making every word drip with conviction, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the brass piece in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"The coin sees," Isaac whispered. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find her. It will root her out. It will bring her back. It always does. It always works. It always bends wills, twists truth, makes people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will bring her back. Because the coin works. It always works."

Townsfolk surrounded Taman, their voices rising, their words pleading, their eyes desperate, begging him to end the suffering by "doing the right thing," by telling where Sela was, by bringing her back, by giving her up, by betraying her, by breaking her, by destroying her, by ending the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

"Please," they begged. "Please tell. Please bring her back. Please end this. Please stop the suffering. Please do the right thing. Please save us. Please protect us. Please ensure us. Please give her up. Please betray her. Please break her. Please destroy her. Please end the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that's building, changing, coming."

Mother was beaten in front of him that afternoon, her body struggling, her voice rising, her fear sharp, immediate, real, the blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, her cries twisting his resolve, her pain breaking his will, her suffering destroying his courage, his strength, his everything.

"Tell," Arpin demanded. "Tell where she is. Tell where she's hidden. Tell before it's too late, before I hurt her more, before I break her more, before I destroy her more. Tell. Tell now. Tell before she suffers more, before she breaks more, before she dies more."

Sela sent a hidden sign from her hiding place that evening, a signal, a message, a trust, believing in Taman, trusting him not to betray her, not to give her up, not to break her, not to destroy her, not to end the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

The sign was small, subtle, barely visible, but Taman saw it, understood it, felt it—a reminder of trust, of hope, of the bond between them, of the weight they shared, of the debt they owed, of the obligation they carried.

Boone avoided his eyes that night, ashamed but unwilling to step in, caught between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen, bear the weight of his silence, his cowardice, his failure.

The hawk circled above the square, screeching once as though mocking the scene, its cry sharp, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Taman cracked then, his resolve breaking, his will failing, his courage destroyed, his strength gone, his everything broken, his voice rising, his words tumbling, his betrayal complete, his trust broken, his hope destroyed.

"I'll bring her in," he said, his voice tight, his words careful, his betrayal complete. "I'll tell where she is. I'll bring her back. I'll give her up. I'll betray her. I'll break her. I'll destroy her. But only if Mother is freed. Only if she's released. Only if she's safe. Only if she's protected. Only if she's ensured. Free Mother. Free her now. Free her before I bring Sela back. Free her before I betray Sela. Free her before I break Sela. Free her before I destroy Sela."

Arpin smiled, his expression satisfied, dangerous. "Done," he said. "Mother will be freed. She will be released. She will be safe. She will be protected. She will be ensured. And you? You will bring Sela back. You will tell where she is. You will give her up. You will betray her. You will break her. You will destroy her. A bargain made. A debt created. An obligation born. And it will all be paid. It will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all come due."

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 28

Taman led Arpin's posse toward Sela's hiding place in the foothills that morning, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his betrayal complete, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken.

Along the way, he silently prayed for a miracle, the missionary's nonsense rattling in his head, words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill, warnings mixing with scripture, prophecies mixing with madness, the weight pressing down, the debt accumulating, the obligation building.

"Please," he prayed. "Please let Sela be gone. Please let her have moved. Please let her have escaped. Please let her have found a way out, a way to freedom, a way to balance, a way to share weight, a way to live whole. Please don't let me find her. Please don't let me betray her. Please don't let me break her. Please don't let me destroy her. Please let her be safe. Please let her be free. Please let her be whole."

But the prayer felt hollow, weak, useless, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Prayers wouldn't help. Miracles wouldn't happen. Hope wouldn't save. The weight was building. The debt was accumulating. The obligation was building. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Isaac toyed with him along the way, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, speaking of balance, temptation, and the cost of secrets, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

"Balance is tricky," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "It shifts. It tips. It responds to choices, to weight, to the things we do. And every choice we make, every weight we shift, every scale we tip—it all matters. It all counts. It all adds up. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show. And secrets? Secrets have cost. Secrets create weight. Secrets shift scales. And the cost is heavy. The weight is real. The truth will show."

They arrived at the hiding place that afternoon, the spot where Sela had been, where she'd hidden, where she'd trusted, where she'd believed, where she'd waited, where she'd hoped.

But Sela had already moved on, slipping away into the deeper woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, leaving only her pouch as a sign, a reminder, a message, a trust broken, a hope destroyed, a bond severed, a weight shifted, a scale tipped.

Arpin raged then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, calling Taman a liar, a betrayer, a traitor, a breaker of bargains, a destroyer of trust, a shifter of scales, a tipper of balance.

"You lied," he shouted. "You betrayed. You broke the bargain. You didn't bring her back. You didn't tell where she was. You didn't give her up. You led us here, to this empty place, to this broken promise, to this failed bargain. And you will pay. You will pay for lying. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking the bargain. You will pay for shifting the scales. You will pay for tipping the balance."

He struck Mother again, his blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, her cries rising, her pain sharp, immediate, real, her suffering destroying everything, breaking everything, ending everything.

Isaac smoothed it over, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, promising the crowd that fate always claims its toll, that debt always comes due, that weight always tells, that truth always shows, that sooner or later, everything pays, everything comes due, everything tells, everything shows.

"The bargain was made," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The debt was created. The obligation was born. And it will all be paid. It will all come due. Sooner or later, fate will claim its toll. Sooner or later, the weight will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show. And when it does, when it comes due, when it tells, when it shows, everything will pay. Everything will come due. Everything will tell. Everything will show."

The earth trembled beneath their feet then, a rumble that silenced all, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the scales shifting, the weight building, the something gathering, preparing, coming.

Taman saw the scales tipping in real time, felt the weight building, sensed the debt accumulating, understood the obligation growing, realized his betrayal wasted, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his everything gone, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 29

Sela slipped deeper into the woods that night, unseen, unheard, untracked, carrying the weight of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her weight shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

She'd trusted him, believed in him, hoped in him, waited for him, sent him a sign, a message, a trust, believing he wouldn't betray her, wouldn't give her up, wouldn't break her, wouldn't destroy her, wouldn't end the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

But he had. He'd betrayed her. He'd given her up. He'd broken her. He'd destroyed her. He'd led Arpin's posse to her hiding place, to her secret, to her trust, to her hope, to her everything.

And now she was alone, deeper in the woods, farther from safety, closer to danger, carrying the weight of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her weight shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

Taman returned to Shadow that evening, a pariah, an outcast, a betrayer, a breaker of trust, a destroyer of hope, a shifter of scales, a tiper of balance.

The townsfolk hissed his name as traitor, their voices sharp, their words cutting, their eyes watching, their movements turning away, their trust broken, their hope destroyed, their bond severed, their weight shifted, their scale tipped, their balance broken.

"Traitor," they hissed. "Betrayer. Breaker of trust. Destroyer of hope. Shifter of scales. Tipper of balance. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her. You ended the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for destroying. You will pay for shifting. You will pay for tipping. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Boone confronted him that night, fury in his voice, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken.

"You sold her out," Boone shouted. "You betrayed her. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her. And for what? For nothing. For a bargain that was broken. For a trust that was destroyed. For a hope that was gone. For a weight that was shifted. For a scale that was tipped. For a balance that was broken. And you will pay. You will pay for selling her out. You will pay for betraying her. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Taman tried to explain, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his everything broken, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken.

But his words fell flat, hollow even in his own ears, empty, useless, meaningless, as if betrayal couldn't be explained, as if trust couldn't be restored, as if hope couldn't be regained, as if weight couldn't be unshifted, as if scale couldn't be untipped, as if balance couldn't be unbroken.

Mother, bruised and bloodied, was still not released that evening, still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of, Arpin claiming Sela's capture is the only price, her weight the only debt, her gift the only obligation, her death the only payment, her sacrifice the only balance, her blood the only scale, her everything the only something.

The missionary clasped his Bible tighter, speaking of Judas and silver, his sermons striking too close, his words cutting, his warnings sharp, his prophecies heavy, his weight building, his debt accumulating, his obligation growing, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac's coin gleamed in torchlight, as if mocking Taman, its brass surface catching the light, reflecting the flames, showing fractured images, broken reflections, pieces of things that didn't quite fit together, as if the coin saw, heard, knew, understood the betrayal, the broken trust, the destroyed hope, the shifted weight, the tipped scale, the broken balance, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Alone in the night, Taman fled into the woods, chasing shadows of Sela and Coyote alike, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 30

Taman wandered among trees whispering with wind that night, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken, the mountain groaning louder, the weight building faster, the scales tipping further, the something gathering closer, preparing harder, coming sooner.

His guilt gnawed at him, sharp and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd become, what he'd chosen—betrayal over trust, cowardice over courage, survival over love, ledger over family, fear over hope, weight over balance, debt over freedom, obligation over choice.

He'd betrayed one sister and failed to save the other, broken one trust and destroyed another hope, shifted one weight and tipped another scale, broken one balance and created another debt, chosen one path and destroyed another way, made one choice and paid another price, lived one moment and lost another everything.

A fire smoldered in the distance, one of the Seven, ash drifting over the pines, the smoke rising, the flames flickering, the heat building, the weight accumulating, the scales shifting, the something gathering, preparing, coming.

He heard his mother's voice echo in the trees that night, not real, but heavy as judgment, her words carrying on the wind, her voice rising and falling, her warnings sharp, her prophecies heavy, her weight building, her debt accumulating, her obligation growing, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Taman," her voice echoed. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You shifted. You tipped. You lost. You failed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

The hawk followed, a sentinel, its cry sharp against the forest's silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Coyote appeared at last, half-shadow, half-smile, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"You've already played once, boy," Coyote teased, his voice smooth. "You've already chosen. You've already paid. You've already shifted. You've already tipped. You've already broken. You've already destroyed. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. Now you're destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again? You want to shift again? You want to tip again? You want to break again? You want to destroy again? Shall we try again?"

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away, a choice that had been made, a path that had been chosen, a weight that had been shifted, a scale that had been tipped, a balance that had been broken, a something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

He realized he was standing in the thinnest place yet—the balance ready to break, the scales ready to tip, the weight ready to shift, the debt ready to accumulate, the obligation ready to grow, the something ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 31

Sela remained in hiding those days, slipping deeper into the woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, her pouch clutched tight, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her weight shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

She carried the weight of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements slow, her steps heavy, her heart breaking, her everything broken, her weight building, her debt accumulating, her obligation growing, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman skulked the forest's edge those days, tormented by visions of Mother in chains, her body bound, her voice silenced, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his betrayal, for his broken trust, for his destroyed hope, for his shifted weight, for his tipped scale, for his broken balance, for his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin paraded through Shadow those days, demanding Sela, building frenzy against her, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, shouting that she must be found, must be brought back, must be given up, must be betrayed, must be broken, must be destroyed, must be ended.

"The weight must be removed," he shouted. "The poison must be eliminated. The corruption must be destroyed. The curse must be burned. The gift must be broken. The burden must be ended. And she must be found. She must be brought back. She must be given up. She must be betrayed. She must be broken. She must be destroyed. She must be ended."

Boone was torn those days, seeing Sela as a sister but feeling powerless, caught between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen, bear the weight of his silence, his cowardice, his failure, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac rubbed his coin those days, whispering that the "curse" must be burned from their midst, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the brass piece in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The missionary muttered half-Bible, half-gibberish those days, confusing even himself, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the weight, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more weight, more debt, more obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk hovered overhead those days, tracking both Taman and Sela, omen of balance, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

At night, Arpin dragged Mother from her cell—his final cruelty just beginning, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp, his actions deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 32

Isaac watched Arpin take his "pound of flesh" from Mother in silence that night, his breathing ragged as he slunk into shadow to clean himself, whispering "balance" as if it absolved him, as if it justified him, as if it made everything right, everything fair, everything balanced.

But balance didn't absolve. Balance didn't justify. Balance didn't make things right. Balance just weighed. Balance just shifted. Balance just tipped. And every weight, every shift, every tip—it all added up. It all accumulated. It all brought the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

Arpin finished and, with chilling tenderness, cradled Mother's head, telling her the pain has been paid, the debt has been cleared, the obligation has been met, the weight has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored.

"It's done," he said, his voice soft, gentle, kind. "The pain is paid. The debt is cleared. The obligation is met. The weight is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored. And you are free. You are released. You are safe. You are protected. You are ensured. You are whole."

But she was not free. She was not released. She was not safe. She was not protected. She was not ensured. She was not whole. She was dead. She was broken. She was destroyed. She was ended. And her last words cursed him, her voice weak, her words careful, her breath coming in gasps, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Balance will find you," she whispered. "Weight will find you. Scales will find you. Truth will find you. And when it does, when it finds you, when it comes due, you will pay. You will pay for everything. You will pay for the pain. You will pay for the debt. You will pay for the obligation. You will pay for the weight. You will pay for the scale. You will pay for the balance. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Arpin killed her gently then, claiming mercy, his movements careful, his actions deliberate, his words soft, his voice kind, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone heard but did nothing, his cowardice hardening into a weight of its own, his silence becoming a debt, his inaction becoming an obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin told the town the debt is settled the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, saying the weight has been shared, the scale has been tipped, the balance has been restored, the something has been resolved.

But Isaac stepped forward, coin glowing faintly, insisting the mountain will keep cracking until Sela's blood feeds the scales, her weight is removed, her gift is broken, her burden is ended, her something is destroyed.

"The debt is settled," Isaac said, his voice smooth. "The weight is shared. The scale is tipped. The balance is restored. But the mountain still groans. The earth still shakes. The scales still tip. And they will keep groaning, keep shaking, keep tipping, until the weight is fully removed, until the poison is fully eliminated, until the corruption is fully destroyed, until Sela's blood feeds the scales, until her weight is removed, until her gift is broken, until her burden is ended, until her something is destroyed."

Arpin seized the turn, declaring Sela's death balance due, whipping the crowd toward frenzy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The trio flanked him then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives, their silent menace sealing the square, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain groaned audibly through the squareboards then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, and even the bravest men looked at their feet, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if the mountain itself was speaking, was judging, was promising something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 33

Taman fled to the east fort that morning, desperate for soldiers or allies to stop the sacrifice, his movements urgent, his voice tight, his words pleading, begging for help, for protection, for salvation, for something that would stop the sacrifice, that would save Sela, that would end the weight, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

The east fort thrived—animals healthy, water clear, air clean, people happy, scales balanced, weight shared, everything as it should be, everything as it could be, everything as it might have been, everything as it might still be.

But its commander refused to meddle in Shadow's self-made storm, his voice polite but firm, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying that Fort Shadow was not their concern, that they could not risk their own balance for someone else's weight, that they had their own people to protect, their own choices to make, their own something to bear.

"We cannot meddle," the commander said, his voice careful. "We cannot interfere. We cannot risk our balance for someone else's weight. We have our own people to protect, our own choices to make, our own something to bear. And Fort Shadow? Fort Shadow made its own choices. Fort Shadow created its own weight. Fort Shadow tipped its own scales. And Fort Shadow must bear its own consequences. Fort Shadow must pay its own debt. Fort Shadow must meet its own obligation. Fort Shadow must face its own something, its own building, its own changing, its own coming."

Taman begged the missionary, who rambled of lambs, Judas, and debts unpaid, offering nothing but noise, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the weight, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more weight, more debt, more obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone arrived secretly that evening, telling Taman that Mother is gone, and Sela will be taken within days, his voice tight, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman collapsed then, his betrayal echoing Judas' thrice denial, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk's shadow crossed his hands then, dark and heavy, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The tribe listened but held their balance, saying they will neither aid Arpin nor take up arms against him, their voice calm, their words careful, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Mercenaries already leaned Arpin's way that evening, Isaac's whispers having reached even here, his coin working its magic, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman turned back anyway, unwilling to leave Sela to the knife, his movements desperate, his voice tight, his words careful, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 34

Arpin announced Sela must still be captured the next morning, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, saying "the curse lingers until the mountain sleeps," the weight remains until the poison is removed, the scales tip until the corruption is destroyed, the something builds until the burden is ended.

"The curse lingers," he shouted. "The weight remains. The scales tip. The something builds. And they will keep lingering, keep remaining, keep tipping, keep building, until the mountain sleeps, until the poison is removed, until the corruption is destroyed, until the burden is ended. And she must be found. She must be captured. She must be brought back. She must be given up. She must be betrayed. She must be broken. She must be destroyed. She must be ended."

His men scoured the woods that day, pressing Boone to lead them, their movements quick, their voices low, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The trio prowled the edges—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—their silent menace sealing the woods, their presence dangerous, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac whispered to Boone that evening, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying "Family betrays family. It is the oldest law," the weight shifts, the scales tip, the balance breaks, the something comes, something that will break, something that will change, something that will end everything.

"Family betrays family," Isaac whispered. "It is the oldest law. The weight shifts. The scales tip. The balance breaks. The something comes. And you, Boone? You will betray. You will break. You will shift. You will tip. You will come. You will lead them. You will show them. You will give her up. You will betray her. You will break her. You will destroy her. You will end her. Because that's the oldest law. That's the weight. That's the scale. That's the balance. That's the something that comes, that breaks, that changes, that ends everything."

Boone broke then, hinting at Sela's trail, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin led the posse himself that evening, coin thrumming in Isaac's pocket, villagers whipped into frenzy, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Sela evaded them through gullies and underbrush that night, slipping into the mountain's shadow but running out of ground, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman rushed back toward Shadow that night, too late—torches already weaving through the trees like a net, their light bright, their movements quick, their voices low, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried to misdirect the posse in small ways that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were shoved aside, their voices silenced, their movements stopped, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

For the first time, the mountain groaned loud enough to knock stones from its slopes that night, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The trio cornered Sela and dragged her back in chains that morning, Kerrick grinning, Silas looping rope, Marlowe silent as knives, their movements quick, their hands rough, their voices loud, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone watched, tears streaking his face, his complicity a wound that won't close, his betrayal complete, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin declared balance must be restored that afternoon, saying Sela's sacrifice will seal it, the weight will be shared, the scales will be tipped, the something will be resolved, the building will stop, the changing will end, the coming will be done.

"Balance must be restored," he shouted. "The weight must be shared. The scales must be tipped. The something must be resolved. And Sela's sacrifice will seal it. Her death will restore it. Her blood will feed it. Her weight will shift it. Her scale will tip it. Her balance will restore it. And then the building will stop. The changing will end. The coming will be done. And everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced. Everything will be whole."

The town, half-hypnotized, nodded along, their voices rising, their movements agreeing, their wills bending, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac whispered scripture twisted into law that evening, coin hot in his hand, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally, even the mercenaries lowering their eyes, their voices falling silent, their movements stilling, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Coyote mocked Taman for trusting the missionary's babble that night, calling him a fool who listens to ghosts that don't know their own tongue, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"You trusted the missionary's babble," Coyote teased. "You listened to ghosts that don't know their own tongue. You believed in prophecies that don't understand their own words. And where did that get you? Where did that lead you? Where did that take you? Nowhere. Lost. Broken. Destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to trust again? You want to believe again? Shall we try again?"

The missionary howled garbled verse that evening, convincing none but unsettling all, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the weight, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman reached Shadow's edge that night, breathless and bloodied, too late again, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Sela called his name then, not in fear but in forgiveness, her voice soft, her words careful, her movements slow, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

And it broke him deeper than any blow, her forgiveness sharper than any blade, her trust harder than any stone, her hope heavier than any weight, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The ground cracked beneath the fort that evening, the mountain's true answer gathering in its throat, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Taman fled deep into the woods that night, half-mad with grief and guilt, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain's groans sounded like voices now—low, hollow, accusing—their words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill, their warnings sharp, their prophecies heavy, their weight building, their debt accumulating, their obligation growing, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Taman," the voices groaned. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You shifted. You tipped. You lost. You failed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

The hawk followed him still, its cry sharp against the silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

In a thin place by the spring, Coyote appeared, grinning, tail flicking, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"You've played this game before, boy," he said, his voice smooth. "You've chosen before. You've paid before. You've shifted before. You've tipped before. You've broken before. You've destroyed before. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. Now you're destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again? You want to shift again? You want to tip again? You want to break again? You want to destroy again? Shall we play again?"

Taman demanded his mother back, demanded Sela's freedom, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I want my mother back," he shouted. "I want Sela free. I want the weight shared. I want the scales balanced. I want the debt cleared. I want the obligation met. I want the something stopped. I want the building ended. I want the changing reversed. I want the coming undone. I want everything back. I want everything right. I want everything fair. I want everything balanced. I want everything whole."

Coyote laughed then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression amused, his movements smooth, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"You want?" Coyote laughed. "You want? You want your mother back? You want Sela free? You want the weight shared? You want the scales balanced? You want everything back? You want everything right? You want everything fair? You want everything balanced? You want everything whole? But what you want doesn't matter. What you need doesn't matter. What you choose matters. What you pay matters. What you shift matters. What you tip matters. What you break matters. What you destroy matters. And you chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you want everything back? Now you want everything right? Now you want everything fair? Now you want everything balanced? Now you want everything whole? But you can't have everything back. You can't have everything right. You can't have everything fair. You can't have everything balanced. You can't have everything whole. Because choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows."

Isaac's whispers echoed faintly then, as though the coin carried across worlds, its words tumbling, its voice rising and falling, its weight building, its debt accumulating, its obligation growing, its something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"The coin sees," the whispers echoed. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find you. It will root you out. It will bring you back. It always does. It always works. It always bends wills, twists truth, makes people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will come back. Because the coin works. It always works."

The first round of their game began then—simple odds, yet neither side wins, the choices balanced, the weight shared, the scales tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 37

The ritual to kill Sela was prepared in Shadow that morning—torches, drums, frenzy—the movements quick, the voices loud, the hands rough, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac told Arpin this act will cement him—the "King of Balance"—his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the coin in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"This act will cement you," Isaac whispered. "This sacrifice will crown you. This weight will make you. This scale will tip you. This balance will restore you. This something will complete you. And you will be king. You will be balance. You will be everything. And everything will be yours. Everything will be under your control. Everything will be under your weight. Everything will be under your scale. Everything will be under your balance. Everything will be under your something, your building, your changing, your coming."

Arpin, drunk on power, paraded Sela before the people like a prize that afternoon, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Look," he shouted. "Look at what we have. Look at the prize. Look at the weight. Look at the scale. Look at the balance. Look at the something we've caught, we've captured, we've brought back. And now? Now we will use it. Now we will break it. Now we will destroy it. Now we will end it. And then? Then everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced. Everything will be whole."

Boone, watching, broke down, whispering apologies no one hears, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry, Sela. I'm sorry, Taman. I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for betraying. I'm sorry for breaking. I'm sorry for destroying. I'm sorry for shifting. I'm sorry for tipping. I'm sorry for losing. I'm sorry for failing. I'm sorry for choosing wrong. I'm sorry for paying wrong. I'm sorry for living wrong. I'm sorry for everything. Sooner or later, I'll pay for everything."

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb each tried in small ways to resist that evening, their movements careful, their words quiet, their actions subtle, but were silenced, their voices stopped, their movements halted, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe flanked Arpin then—Kerrick with axe, Silas looping rope, Marlowe sharpening knives—the town's sins given muscle, their movements quick, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

In the woods, Taman lost again and again in Coyote's games that day, blood dripping from his bitten tongue, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain shook that evening, splitting stones, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The sky burned an unnatural red that night, the color sharp, vivid, dangerous, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 38

Coyote offered Taman the last game that morning—a coin toss, simple, pure chance—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"One last game," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "One last choice. One last payment. One last shift. One last tip. One last break. One last destroy. One last chance to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything, to make everything right, everything fair, everything balanced, everything whole. One last chance. One last game. One last choice. Shall we play?"

Taman hesitated—he knew chance was balance, but his desperation blinded him, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I'll play," he said, his voice tight. "I'll choose. I'll pay. I'll shift. I'll tip. I'll break. I'll destroy. I'll do anything. I'll pay anything. I'll shift anything. I'll tip anything. I'll break anything. I'll destroy anything. Just give me a chance. Just give me a choice. Just give me a way to change everything, to fix everything, to restore everything, to make everything right, everything fair, everything balanced, everything whole."

He called it, lost, and raged, blood choking his mouth, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"No," he raged. "No, I lost. No, I chose wrong. No, I paid wrong. No, I shifted wrong. No, I tipped wrong. No, I broke wrong. No, I destroyed wrong. No, I can't have everything back. No, I can't have everything right. No, I can't have everything fair. No, I can't have everything balanced. No, I can't have everything whole. No, I chose wrong. No, I paid wrong. No, everything is wrong. No, everything is broken. No, everything is destroyed. No, everything is lost. No, everything is gone. No, everything is over."

Coyote tilted his head, amused, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Balance always wins," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "You only speed it along. Choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you speed it along. Now you bring it closer. Now you make it happen. Now you make it break. Now you make it change. Now you make it come. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all pay. Sooner or later, it will all tell. Sooner or later, it will all show."

Taman felt something break then—not outside, but inside—his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk wheeled overhead then, vanishing into the smoke rising from the mountain, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Back at Shadow, the ritual began that evening, Isaac nearly trembling with ecstasy, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin raised his knife to Sela's throat that night, the blade sharp, the moment heavy, the choice made, the payment due, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The ground buckled then, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 39

The eruption tore the sky that night, black smoke blotting out stars, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The fort shuddered then, walls crack and tumble, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the weight building, the scales tipping, the balance breaking, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Lava and ash roared down the slope like a living beast, the flames bright, the heat intense, the destruction complete, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe fought the chaos, their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

But their cruelty could not stop stone and fire, their weapons useless, their strength failing, their will breaking, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb were swept aside then—virtue crushed alongside sin—their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands reaching, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin, screaming, clutched Isaac's coin as the heat consumed him, his movements desperate, his voice loud, his words sharp, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac laughed even as his body burned, promising he will return, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I will return," he laughed. "I will come back. I will find you. I will root you out. I will bring you back. I always do. I always work. I always bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will come back. Because I work. I always work."

Taman saw only red and gray then as the world split—his body falling one way, his name the other—the ground cracking, the sky burning, the mountain erupting, the weight shifting, the scale tipping, the balance breaking, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

# Chapter 40

Taman awakened in the thin place that morning, alone, pouch clutched tight, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

His name caught in his throat—bitten off, unsaid—the words tumbling, the voice rising and falling, the weight building, the debt accumulating, the obligation growing, the something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

On the other side, another form rose, empty, grinning—Walter born—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

Coyote sat on the spring's edge, watching both with sly amusement, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

"One became two," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "Balance shifts. The game goes on. Choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you are two. Now you are split. Now you are divided. Now you are broken. Now you are destroyed. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all pay. Sooner or later, it will all tell. Sooner or later, it will all show."

The hawk returned then, circling once before vanishing into the mirror-sky, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance had broken, as if the scales had tipped, as if the something had come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

Shadow was buried under ash and stone, erased, as if it never was, the ground cracked, the sky burned, the mountain erupted, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

The tale closed not with triumph, but with silence—the birth of the Gray-Touched, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
