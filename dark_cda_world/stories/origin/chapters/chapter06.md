# Chapter 6 – The Weight of Names

The ash-scented wind lasted three days. By the fourth morning, it had faded, but the memory of it lingered, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

Sela found him at the edge of the settlement, looking east toward the timber. She moved quietly, the way she always did, and he felt her presence before he heard her.

"You're thinking about leaving again," she said, not a question.

Taman didn't turn. "Arpin won't let me. The ledger says I have obligations."

Sela moved to stand beside him, her hands steady at her sides. "The ledger is just numbers, Taman. It can't hold you if you don't let it."

He looked at her then, saw the way she carried herself, the way she held the weight of the moment without letting it break her. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. But gifts had costs, and Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching.

"It's not just the ledger," Taman said. "It's the weight. The way things are building. Can't you feel it?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "I feel it. But running won't help. The weight follows you. It's part of you now. Part of what you carry."

Taman thought about the pouch at his belt, about the way it felt heavier lately, about the way it seemed to hold something he couldn't see. He thought about the coin, too, though he tried not to. He'd never used it, had never wanted to, but he carried it, and that was enough. Carrying it created weight, and weight had consequences.

"What if I'm the problem?" Taman asked. "What if the weight is building because of me, because of what I carry?"

Sela looked at him, her expression steady. "The weight is building because of choices, Taman. Not because of what you carry, but because of what you do with it. The pouch and the coin are just tools. It's how you use them that matters."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that he could choose, that he could control the weight, that he could balance the scales. But he'd seen how Isaac used his coin, how it bent things toward agreement. He'd seen how Arpin used the ledgers, how numbers became chains. And he wondered if the tools themselves had weight, if carrying them was enough to tip the scales.

"Mother says names have weight," Taman said, changing the subject. "That speaking someone's name with meaning adds to the scales."

Sela nodded. "She's right. Names carry weight. Speaking them with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. That's why she's careful with them. That's why we all should be."

Taman thought about that. He thought about the way Arpin used names, the way he spoke them with calculated kindness, the way he made people feel seen, heard, valued. Every name he spoke created obligation, created weight, created chains that bound people to him.

"What if someone uses names wrong?" Taman asked. "What if they use them to bind people, to create weight that shouldn't exist?"

Sela was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Then the scales will balance. Eventually. The weight can't accumulate forever. Something has to give. Something has to break."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Something has to give. Something has to break. The words felt like a warning, like a promise. The weight was building, and eventually, it would break. The question was what would break first—the settlement, the mountain, or him.

They stood together in silence, watching the timber, watching the mountain, watching the way the world felt wrong, felt heavy, felt like it was waiting for something.

That afternoon, Taman found himself at the central yard, watching Arpin work. The trader moved through the settlement like he owned it, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. And every time he spoke someone's name, Taman felt the weight of it, felt the way it created obligation, felt the way it bound people to him.

"Tom," Arpin said, his voice warm, his smile wide. "How's the work going? I heard you've been putting in extra hours. That's the kind of dedication we need."

Tom's face lit up, and Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Arpin had spoken his name with calculated kindness, and now Tom felt seen, felt valued, felt obligated. The name carried weight, and that weight bound Tom to Arpin in a way that couldn't be measured in flour or coin.

"Ruth," Arpin said, turning to Tom's wife. "You're looking well. I hope your husband's been taking care of you. A good man like Tom deserves a good woman like you."

Ruth smiled, and Taman felt the weight of that, too. Two names, spoken with meaning, creating obligation, creating chains.

"Mary," Arpin said, moving on. "I was just thinking about you. How's your husband? Is he feeling better? If you need anything, anything at all, you just let me know."

Mary's face lit up with gratitude, and Taman felt the weight of it all pressing down. Names, spoken with calculated kindness, creating obligation, creating weight, creating a system that bound people tighter than rope.

Isaac followed behind Arpin, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. And Taman felt the weight of that, too, the way it made everything feel inevitable, the way it made the moment feel like it had already been decided.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And names were part of it, names spoken with meaning, names that created obligation, names that bound people in ways they didn't understand.

Taman put his hand on his pouch, felt its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and names carried weight, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
