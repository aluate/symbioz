# Chapter 40 – The Split

Taman awakened in the thin place that morning, alone, pouch clutched tight, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

His name caught in his throat—bitten off, unsaid—the words tumbling, the voice rising and falling, the weight building, the debt accumulating, the obligation growing, the something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

On the other side, another form rose, empty, grinning—Walter born—his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

Coyote sat on the spring's edge, watching both with sly amusement, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, his something coming, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

"One became two," Coyote said, his voice smooth. "Balance shifts. The game goes on. Choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows. And you? You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you are two. Now you are split. Now you are divided. Now you are broken. Now you are destroyed. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, it will all pay. Sooner or later, it will all tell. Sooner or later, it will all show."

The hawk returned then, circling once before vanishing into the mirror-sky, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance had broken, as if the scales had tipped, as if the something had come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

Shadow was buried under ash and stone, erased, as if it never was, the ground cracked, the sky burned, the mountain erupted, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

The tale closed not with triumph, but with silence—the birth of the Gray-Touched, the weight shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something come, something that had broken, something that had changed, something that had ended everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
