# Chapter 30 – Into the Woods

Taman wandered among trees whispering with wind that night, his movements slow, his steps heavy, his heart breaking, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his everything broken, the mountain groaning louder, the weight building faster, the scales tipping further, the something gathering closer, preparing harder, coming sooner.

His guilt gnawed at him, sharp and constant, a reminder of what he'd done, what he'd become, what he'd chosen—betrayal over trust, cowardice over courage, survival over love, ledger over family, fear over hope, weight over balance, debt over freedom, obligation over choice.

He'd betrayed one sister and failed to save the other, broken one trust and destroyed another hope, shifted one weight and tipped another scale, broken one balance and created another debt, chosen one path and destroyed another way, made one choice and paid another price, lived one moment and lost another everything.

A fire smoldered in the distance, one of the Seven, ash drifting over the pines, the smoke rising, the flames flickering, the heat building, the weight accumulating, the scales shifting, the something gathering, preparing, coming.

He heard his mother's voice echo in the trees that night, not real, but heavy as judgment, her words carrying on the wind, her voice rising and falling, her warnings sharp, her prophecies heavy, her weight building, her debt accumulating, her obligation growing, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Taman," her voice echoed. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You shifted. You tipped. You lost. You failed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

The hawk followed, a sentinel, its cry sharp against the forest's silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Coyote appeared at last, half-shadow, half-smile, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"You've already played once, boy," Coyote teased, his voice smooth. "You've already chosen. You've already paid. You've already shifted. You've already tipped. You've already broken. You've already destroyed. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. Now you're destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again? You want to shift again? You want to tip again? You want to break again? You want to destroy again? Shall we try again?"

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a weight that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away, a choice that had been made, a path that had been chosen, a weight that had been shifted, a scale that had been tipped, a balance that had been broken, a something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

He realized he was standing in the thinnest place yet—the balance ready to break, the scales ready to tip, the weight ready to shift, the debt ready to accumulate, the obligation ready to grow, the something ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
