# Chapter 36 – The Palaver Begins

Taman fled deep into the woods that night, half-mad with grief and guilt, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The mountain's groans sounded like voices now—low, hollow, accusing—their words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill, their warnings sharp, their prophecies heavy, their weight building, their debt accumulating, their obligation growing, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"Taman," the voices groaned. "Taman, you betrayed. You broke. You destroyed. You shifted. You tipped. You lost. You failed. You chose wrong. You paid wrong. You lived wrong. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

The hawk followed him still, its cry sharp against the silence, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

In a thin place by the spring, Coyote appeared, grinning, tail flicking, his movements smooth, his voice careful, his words deliberate, offering games instead of answers, choices instead of solutions, weight instead of balance, debt instead of freedom, obligation instead of hope.

"You've played this game before, boy," he said, his voice smooth. "You've chosen before. You've paid before. You've shifted before. You've tipped before. You've broken before. You've destroyed before. And now? Now you're here. Now you're lost. Now you're broken. Now you're destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to pay again? You want to shift again? You want to tip again? You want to break again? You want to destroy again? Shall we play again?"

Taman demanded his mother back, demanded Sela's freedom, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression desperate, his movements urgent, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I want my mother back," he shouted. "I want Sela free. I want the weight shared. I want the scales balanced. I want the debt cleared. I want the obligation met. I want the something stopped. I want the building ended. I want the changing reversed. I want the coming undone. I want everything back. I want everything right. I want everything fair. I want everything balanced. I want everything whole."

Coyote laughed then, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression amused, his movements smooth, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"You want?" Coyote laughed. "You want? You want your mother back? You want Sela free? You want the weight shared? You want the scales balanced? You want everything back? You want everything right? You want everything fair? You want everything balanced? You want everything whole? But what you want doesn't matter. What you need doesn't matter. What you choose matters. What you pay matters. What you shift matters. What you tip matters. What you break matters. What you destroy matters. And you chose wrong. You paid wrong. You shifted wrong. You tipped wrong. You broke wrong. You destroyed wrong. And now? Now you want everything back? Now you want everything right? Now you want everything fair? Now you want everything balanced? Now you want everything whole? But you can't have everything back. You can't have everything right. You can't have everything fair. You can't have everything balanced. You can't have everything whole. Because choices matter. Payment matters. Weight matters. Scale matters. Balance matters. And sooner or later, it all comes due. Sooner or later, it all pays. Sooner or later, it all tells. Sooner or later, it all shows."

Isaac's whispers echoed faintly then, as though the coin carried across worlds, its words tumbling, its voice rising and falling, its weight building, its debt accumulating, its obligation growing, its something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"The coin sees," the whispers echoed. "The coin hears. The coin knows. And it will find you. It will root you out. It will bring you back. It always does. It always works. It always bends wills, twists truth, makes people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will come back. Because the coin works. It always works."

The first round of their game began then—simple odds, yet neither side wins, the choices balanced, the weight shared, the scales tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
