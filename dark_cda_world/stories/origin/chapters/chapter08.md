# Chapter 8 – Boone's Silence

The next morning, Taman found Boone at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers. The sun was high overhead, but the day felt heavy, wrong, and Taman could still see Hiram's blood in the dust, could still hear the crowd cheering, could still feel the weight of his own inaction.

"We have to do something," Taman said, not bothering with pleasantries. "We can't just stand by and watch. Hiram spoke the truth, and Arpin beat him for it. If we don't stand against this, we're complicit."

Boone looked up from the ledger, his expression troubled. "I know, Taman. I know it's wrong. But what can we do? Arpin has the crowd. Isaac's coin has them. If we stand against him now, we'll be next. We'll be the ones beaten, the ones locked away."

"We have to try," Taman said. "You, me, Sela—we stand together. We speak the truth. We show people that there's another way."

Boone closed the ledger and set it aside. "And what happens when Arpin beats us? When Isaac's coin turns the crowd against us? When we're locked away, just like Hiram? Who protects our family then? Who keeps them safe?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Boone was right, in a way. Standing against Arpin now would be dangerous. It would put them at risk, put their family at risk. But doing nothing was also dangerous. The weight was building, the scales were tipping, and if they didn't do something, if they didn't stand against it, then they were part of the problem.

"Playing along isn't protecting anyone," Taman said. "It's just making it worse. Every day we stay silent, every day we let Arpin rule, the weight builds. The scales tip further. Eventually, something has to break. And when it does, we'll all be caught in it."

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest, troubled. "I know you're right, Taman. I know the weight is building. I can feel it too. But I also know that if we stand against Arpin now, we'll lose. We'll be beaten, locked away, and nothing will change. But if we play along, if we learn the system, if we understand how it works, then maybe we can find a way to change it from within. Maybe we can protect our family and still make a difference."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that playing along was a strategy, that learning the system was a way to change it. But he'd seen how Arpin worked, how Isaac's coin bent things, how the ledgers bound people. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that playing along wasn't a strategy—it was surrender.

"Boone," Taman said, his voice firm. "Stand with me. Stand with Sela. We can do this together."

Boone shook his head. "I can't, Taman. Not yet. Not like this. I need to protect our family. I need to keep them safe. And right now, that means playing along. That means learning the system. That means waiting for the right moment."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to stand with him. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in fear, in the need to protect, in the belief that playing along was the only way. And maybe he was right. Maybe standing against Arpin now would only make things worse. But Taman couldn't shake the feeling that doing nothing was also wrong, that silence was complicity, that the weight was building and something had to give.

He left Boone there, standing at the edge of the settlement, looking over the ledgers, and he felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He needed guidance. He needed wisdom. He needed someone to tell him what to do, how to fight this, how to stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away.

Desperate, he slipped into the missionary's crooked chapel.

It was a small building, tucked away at the edge of the settlement, built from scraps and salvaged wood. The walls were crooked, the roof sagged, and the whole thing looked like it might collapse at any moment. But it was a place of refuge, a place where people came to seek guidance, to find answers, to understand the weight of the world.

The missionary was inside, muttering to himself, his Bible open in his hands. He looked up as Taman entered, his eyes wild, his expression troubled.

"Ah," the missionary said, his voice carrying in the small space. "Another seeker. Another soul looking for answers. But answers are heavy, boy. They carry weight. Are you ready to bear it?"

Taman sat on a rough bench, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. "I need to know what to do," he said. "Arpin is wrong. His rule is wrong. But if I stand against him, I'll be beaten, locked away, just like Hiram. And if I don't, I'm complicit. I'm part of the problem. What do I do?"

The missionary looked at him for a long moment, his expression shifting, becoming thoughtful. "Names weigh more than sins," he said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "That's what you need to understand. Names carry weight. Speaking them with meaning, with anger, with love, with betrayal—it all adds up. And even Christ stumbled under His Cross. Even He bore the weight. But He bore it. He didn't run from it. He didn't hide from it. He faced it, and He bore it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. Names weigh more than sins. Even Christ stumbled under His Cross. The words felt like riddles, like puzzles he couldn't solve. What did they mean? How did they help? What was he supposed to do?

"But how?" Taman asked. "How do I face it? How do I bear it? How do I stand against Arpin without getting beaten, without getting locked away?"

The missionary shook his head. "There is no way, boy. There is no path that avoids the weight. You stand, or you don't. You bear it, or you break. That's the choice. That's always been the choice."

Taman felt frustration building. He'd come here for answers, for guidance, for a way forward. But the missionary was giving him riddles, giving him questions instead of answers, giving him weight instead of relief.

"Then what's the point?" Taman asked. "If there's no way to avoid it, if standing means getting beaten, if bearing it means breaking, then what's the point of trying?"

The missionary looked at him, his expression shifting, becoming almost gentle. "The point is the choice, boy. The point is that you choose. You choose to stand, or you choose to run. You choose to bear it, or you choose to break. The weight doesn't care. The scales don't care. But you care. And that's what matters. That's what makes the difference."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to demand better answers, wanted to find a way forward. But before he could speak, Isaac passed by outside, his hand deep in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

The missionary's voice faltered mid-verse, as though unseen fingers had pinched it shut. He looked toward the door, his expression shifting, becoming troubled, and Taman felt the weight of Isaac's presence, the way it bent things, the way it silenced voices.

"The coin," the missionary whispered, his voice barely audible. "The coin bends things. It makes truth feel flexible. It makes choices feel inevitable. And when it's near, even the words falter. Even the verses fail."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Isaac's coin was powerful, more powerful than he'd realized. It didn't just bend people—it bent truth, it bent words, it bent the very fabric of the moment. And when it was near, even the missionary's voice faltered, even his verses failed.

Isaac moved on, his hand still in his pocket, thumb still working that coin, and the missionary's voice returned, but it was weaker now, more uncertain.

"There is no god here," the missionary said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "No white god, no native god, no god that will fight this battle for you. The weight is yours to bear. The choice is yours to make. And no god will save you from it."

Taman felt the weight of those words pressing down. No god would fight this battle for him. The weight was his to bear. The choice was his to make. And there was no way to avoid it, no path that didn't lead through the weight, through the beating, through the lockup.

He left the chapel more lost than before, realizing that no god here—white or native—would fight this battle for him. The weight was his. The choice was his. And he had to make it, had to bear it, had to face it, or he had to run, had to hide, had to break.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And Taman was alone, lost, with no god to save him, no path that avoided the weight.

Something had to give. Something had to break.

And he was starting to think it might be him.
