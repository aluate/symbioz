# Chapter 4 – The Spring That Remembers

A week after the dream, Taman decided to hike to the high spring. It was a place he'd visited before, a thin place where the water ran clear and cold from a crack in the rock. But something had been calling him there, a pull he couldn't name, and he needed to see it for himself.

The path wound up the lower slopes of Olayah, following a game trail that had been worn smooth by generations of animals. Taman moved through it with the quiet patience of a tracker, reading the ground, watching the sky. The hawk was with him again, making slow circles overhead, and he felt its presence like a weight, like a witness.

By midday, he'd reached the spring. It was a small pool, maybe ten feet across, fed by water that trickled from a crack in the rock face above. The water was clear, almost too clear, and it reflected the sky and the trees with a clarity that felt unnatural.

Taman knelt at the edge of the pool, looking down at his reflection. For a moment, everything was normal. He saw his own face looking back at him, tired and worried, the face of a young man carrying too much weight.

Then the reflection stuttered.

It was a small thing, barely noticeable. His reflection flickered, like a candle in the wind, and for a heartbeat, he saw something else—something older, something split, something that wasn't quite him. Then it was back to normal, his own face looking up at him, but the moment had been enough.

The reflection knew something. The spring remembered something he didn't.

Taman straightened and stepped back from the pool. The hawk had stopped circling and was now perched on a branch nearby, its head tilted, watching him. It was close, closer than hawks usually got, and Taman felt the weight of its attention.

The bird's eyes were dark, intelligent, and they seemed to be counting him, measuring him, as if it was keeping track of something only it could see. Taman had heard stories about hawks, about how they witnessed things, about how they marked turning points. He'd never put much stock in them, but now, with the bird so close, he wondered.

"You're watching," he said, not expecting an answer.

The hawk just stared at him, its head tilted, and Taman felt the weight of that stare like a physical thing. Something was happening. Something was changing. The spring knew it. The hawk knew it. And he was starting to know it too.

He was about to turn away when a voice spoke from behind him.

"Interesting place, isn't it?"

Taman spun around, his hand going to the knife at his belt. A man stood there, leaning against a tree, and Taman had no idea how he'd gotten there. He hadn't heard footsteps, hadn't seen movement. The man had just appeared, as if he'd been there all along.

He was tall and lean, with dark hair and eyes that seemed to shift color in the light. He wore simple clothes—buckskin and cloth—but there was something about him that felt wrong, something that didn't quite fit. He moved with a fluid grace that was almost animal, and his smile was sharp, knowing.

"Coyote," Taman said, though he wasn't sure how he knew the name.

The man's smile widened. "You've heard of me. Good. That makes this easier."

Taman's hand stayed on his knife. "What do you want?"

Coyote pushed away from the tree and moved closer, his steps silent on the forest floor. "I want to talk. I want to offer you something. A choice, really. That's what I do—I offer choices."

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd heard stories about Coyote, about how he appeared at crossroads, about how he tested people, about how every bargain with him had a cost. But he'd never expected to meet him, never expected to be standing here, at the high spring, with Coyote watching him with those shifting eyes.

"What kind of choice?" Taman asked.

Coyote reached into his pocket and pulled out a coin. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and Taman recognized it immediately. It was the same kind of coin Isaac used, the same kind that amplified persuasion, that bent things toward agreement.

But this one felt different. This one felt heavier, more dangerous.

"Let's flip it," Coyote said, holding the coin up. "Heads, you walk away. Tails, you stay and we talk. Simple. Fair. A choice made by chance."

Taman looked at the coin, at the way it caught the light. He knew he shouldn't. He knew that every bargain with Coyote had a cost, that every choice had weight. But he also felt the pull of it, the way the moment seemed to demand a decision.

"Balance prefers choices," Coyote said, his voice soft, almost a whisper. "The scales don't care about chance. They care about what you decide. So let's make it a choice. You call it. Heads or tails. You decide, and we'll see what happens."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. The spring was watching. The hawk was watching. Coyote was watching. And he had to choose.

"Heads," he said, not sure why.

Coyote flipped the coin. It spun in the air, catching the light, and for a moment, Taman thought he saw both sides at once—heads and tails, spinning together, refusing to commit. Then it landed in Coyote's palm, and the man closed his hand around it.

"Heads it is," Coyote said, opening his hand. The coin showed heads, clear as day.

Taman felt a strange mix of relief and disappointment. He'd called it, and he'd won. He could walk away. But part of him wanted to stay, wanted to hear what Coyote had to say, wanted to know what choice he was really being offered.

"You can go," Coyote said, his smile sharp. "You called it, and you won. The choice was yours, and you made it. That's how it works. But remember—balance prefers choices. Not chance. Not luck. Choices. And you just made one."

Taman looked at the spring, at his reflection that had stuttered. He looked at the hawk, still perched nearby, still watching. He looked at Coyote, with his shifting eyes and his knowing smile.

"What did I choose?" Taman asked.

Coyote's smile widened. "You chose to call it. You chose to play. You chose to engage with the moment instead of walking away. That's the choice that matters. The coin flip was just the excuse."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. He'd thought he was choosing heads or tails, but he'd really been choosing to engage, to play Coyote's game, to accept the moment. And now he was bound to it, in a way he didn't fully understand.

"The spring knows you," Coyote said, his voice soft. "It knows your weight. It knows what you carry. That's why your reflection stuttered. It's trying to show you something, but you're not ready to see it yet."

Taman looked at the spring, at the clear water that reflected everything with unnatural clarity. The spring knew him. It knew his weight. It knew what he carried—the pouch, the coin, the choices that were piling up, the weight that was building.

"What does it want to show me?" Taman asked.

Coyote's smile was sharp, knowing. "That's for you to find out. But remember—the spring remembers. It remembers everything. Every choice, every weight, every moment of imbalance. And it's waiting. Just like the mountain. Just like the scales. Waiting for you to tip them."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. The spring was waiting. The mountain was waiting. The scales were waiting. And he was the one who had to choose, the one who had to tip them.

He turned and walked away, leaving Coyote at the spring, leaving the hawk watching, leaving his reflection stuttering in the clear water. But he knew he'd be back. He knew this wasn't over. He'd made a choice, and choices had weight, and weight had consequences.

The spring knew him. It knew his weight. And it was waiting.
