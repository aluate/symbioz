# Chapter 35 – The Breaking Point

The trio cornered Sela and dragged her back in chains that morning, Kerrick grinning, Silas looping rope, Marlowe silent as knives, their movements quick, their hands rough, their voices loud, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone watched, tears streaking his face, his complicity a wound that won't close, his betrayal complete, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his weight shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin declared balance must be restored that afternoon, saying Sela's sacrifice will seal it, the weight will be shared, the scales will be tipped, the something will be resolved, the building will stop, the changing will end, the coming will be done.

"Balance must be restored," he shouted. "The weight must be shared. The scales must be tipped. The something must be resolved. And Sela's sacrifice will seal it. Her death will restore it. Her blood will feed it. Her weight will shift it. Her scale will tip it. Her balance will restore it. And then the building will stop. The changing will end. The coming will be done. And everything will be right. Everything will be fair. Everything will be balanced. Everything will be whole."

The town, half-hypnotized, nodded along, their voices rising, their movements agreeing, their wills bending, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac whispered scripture twisted into law that evening, coin hot in his hand, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally, even the mercenaries lowering their eyes, their voices falling silent, their movements stilling, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Coyote mocked Taman for trusting the missionary's babble that night, calling him a fool who listens to ghosts that don't know their own tongue, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"You trusted the missionary's babble," Coyote teased. "You listened to ghosts that don't know their own tongue. You believed in prophecies that don't understand their own words. And where did that get you? Where did that lead you? Where did that take you? Nowhere. Lost. Broken. Destroyed. And you want to play again? You want to choose again? You want to trust again? You want to believe again? Shall we try again?"

The missionary howled garbled verse that evening, convincing none but unsettling all, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the weight, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman reached Shadow's edge that night, breathless and bloodied, too late again, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Sela called his name then, not in fear but in forgiveness, her voice soft, her words careful, her movements slow, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

And it broke him deeper than any blow, her forgiveness sharper than any blade, her trust harder than any stone, her hope heavier than any weight, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The ground cracked beneath the fort that evening, the mountain's true answer gathering in its throat, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The weight followed. The weight always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
