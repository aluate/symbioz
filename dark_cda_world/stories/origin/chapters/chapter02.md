# Chapter 2 – Fort Shadow

The next morning, Fort Shadow woke to its usual rhythm. The smith’s anvil rang out first, a steady clang that cut through the dawn mist. Then came the carpenter’s saw, its teeth biting into wood with a patient, rhythmic whine. By the time the sun had cleared the palisade, the settlement was fully alive—women gathering at the well, their voices carrying across the yard, children already running under Sela’s watchful eye.

Taman stood at the edge of the central yard, watching it all unfold. There was a pattern to it, a dance he’d learned to read. The way people moved, the way they spoke, the way they avoided certain corners or lingered too long at others. It told a story, if you knew how to listen.

Arpin moved through it all like he owned the place, which in a way, he did. He’d arrived six months ago with wagons full of goods and a ledger system that had changed everything. Now he walked the yard with a smile that never quite reached his eyes, stopping here and there to speak with people, to measure out kindness like credit. A word of encouragement to the smith. A pat on the shoulder for a woman struggling with a heavy bucket. A promise to look into someone’s concern about the next supply run.

It all looked generous. It all felt calculated.

Isaac followed a few paces behind, always there, always watching. He moved like a shadow, his presence felt more than seen. When Arpin stopped to talk, Isaac would linger at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman had learned to watch for it, that small motion, the way it made people nod and agree and walk away feeling like they’d been heard, even when nothing had really changed.

A dispute was brewing near the supply shed. Taman could hear the voices rising, could see the way people were gathering. He moved closer, not wanting to be noticed, but needing to see.

It was about flour again. A man named Tom stood with his arms crossed, his face tight. His wife, a woman named Ruth, stood beside him, looking worried.

“We were promised a full share,” Tom said, his voice carrying. “The ledger shows it. We’ve been working extra shifts, doing everything you asked. Where’s our flour?”

Arpin stood calm and reasonable, the ledger open in his hands. “I understand your frustration, Tom. But you have to understand—we’re all sharing resources here. The ledger shows your credit, yes, but it also shows that you received an advance last month. That needs to be balanced against your current allocation.”

“An advance?” Tom’s voice rose. “That was payment for the work we did on the palisade. You said it was payment, not a loan.”

“And it was,” Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. “But the way the system works, everything gets balanced. You received goods early, which means your current allocation is adjusted. It’s all here in the ledger. See?”

He held the book out, but Tom didn’t look at it. He was looking at Isaac, who stood just behind Arpin, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman felt that familiar tightness in his chest. He’d seen this before. The way Arpin’s words made sense on the surface, but didn’t add up underneath. The way Isaac’s presence made people doubt themselves, made them agree to things they shouldn’t.

“I suppose,” Tom said slowly, his shoulders slumping. “If that’s how the system works.”

Ruth looked relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. “Thank you, Arpin. We understand. We’ll make do.”

Arpin smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes. “That’s the spirit. We’re all in this together. The ledgers keep everything fair.”

Isaac’s hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that coin, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it bent things toward agreement. The dispute resolved, people drifted away, and Arpin moved on to the next person, the next kindness, the next measure of credit.

Taman turned away, not wanting to watch anymore. He found Boone at the edge of the yard, sitting on a crate with a ledger open in his lap.

“Morning,” Boone said, looking up. “You look troubled.”

Taman sat beside him. “Just watching.”

Boone nodded, as if that explained everything. He closed the ledger and set it aside. “You know, I used to think the world was chaos. That there was no way to make sense of it, no way to predict what would happen next. But these ledgers—they change everything. They show you the pattern. They show you how things connect.”

He picked up the book again, opening it to a page filled with columns and numbers. “See here? This is Tom and Ruth’s account. You can see their work credits, their advances, their allocations. Everything balanced, everything accounted for. It’s like a map, Taman. A map to safety. If you know where you stand, if you know what you owe and what’s owed to you, then you can plan. You can make decisions. You can protect yourself.”

Taman looked at the columns, at the neat rows of numbers. He understood what Boone was saying. There was a comfort in it, a sense of order. But he also saw how those numbers could be twisted, how a small adjustment here or there could change everything, how the ledger could make truth feel flexible.

“What if the numbers are wrong?” Taman asked.

Boone looked at him, his expression earnest. “That’s the beauty of it. The numbers can’t be wrong. They’re just numbers. They show what is. If there’s a discrepancy, it’s because something in the real world doesn’t match. The ledger helps you find that, helps you fix it. It’s a tool, Taman. A tool for making things fair.”

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the ledgers were just tools, that they made things fair. But he’d seen how Arpin used them, how Isaac’s coin made people agree to things they shouldn’t. He’d seen how the numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

Before he could say anything else, a figure moved through the yard, and the conversation died.

It was the missionary. Taman had seen him before, a gaunt man in dark clothes who moved like a shade through the settlement. He didn’t belong to Fort Shadow—he’d come from somewhere else, following some calling Taman didn’t understand. He moved through the yard now, muttering under his breath, his eyes fixed on something only he could see.

“Crooked things,” the missionary said, his voice carrying in the quiet. “Crooked things in crooked places. The earth knows. The earth remembers. Tremors coming. Weight shifting. Can’t you feel it? Can’t you see it?”

People moved away from him, giving him space. They’d learned to ignore him, to treat his mutterings as the ramblings of a madman. But Taman watched him, and he felt something cold settle in his chest.

The missionary stopped near the well, his head tilted back, looking at the sky. “The mountain watches. The mountain waits. When the scales tip too far, when the weight becomes too much, the mountain will answer. Tremors first. Then the fire. Then the split. Can’t you see it coming?”

His voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried. Taman felt the words settle in him, felt them resonate with something he already knew, something he’d been feeling but couldn’t name.

The missionary moved on, gliding through the yard like a shade, muttering about crooked things and tremors and weight that couldn’t be held. People ignored him, went back to their work, but Taman couldn’t shake the feeling that the man was seeing something real, something everyone else was choosing not to see.

A small shake rattled a chain hanging from the smith’s forge. It was a minor thing, barely noticeable, but Taman felt it in his bones. The ground-hum he’d learned to trust was still there, but it felt different now. Thinner. Strained.

Arpin noticed the shake too. He looked up from his conversation, his eyes scanning the yard. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, “Just settling. The ground settles sometimes. Nothing to worry about.”

People nodded, relieved. They wanted to believe him. They wanted to believe that everything was fine, that the ledgers would keep them safe, that the world would hold.

But Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down, felt the way things were shifting. He thought about the elk tracks, about that slow circle in the timber. He thought about Isaac’s coin, about the way it made people agree. He thought about the missionary’s words, about tremors and weight and the mountain waiting.

The ground-hum was still there, but it was changing. The balance was holding, but for how long?

Taman put his hand on his pouch, felt its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt different now. Tighter. As if it was holding something he couldn’t see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

The settlement went about its business, the rhythm of the day continuing. The smith’s anvil rang out. The carpenter’s saw whined. Women gathered at the well. Children ran under Sela’s watchful eye.

But Taman felt the weight of it all, felt the way things were shifting, felt the ground-hum that meant balance was holding—but just barely.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain Olayah loomed, its peak hidden in cloud, waiting.
