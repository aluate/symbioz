# Chapter 7 – First Blood

The tension in Fort Shadow had been building for days, a slow pressure that Taman felt in his bones. The ash-scented wind was gone, but the memory of it lingered, and people moved through the settlement with a wariness that hadn't been there before. The ground-hum felt thinner, strained, and Taman found himself watching the mountain more often, waiting for something he couldn't name.

That morning, the blacksmith spoke.

His name was Hiram, and he was a big man, broad-shouldered and steady, with hands that could shape iron and a voice that carried. He'd been quiet since Arpin's arrival, working his forge, keeping his head down, doing what he could to survive. But something had changed. The weight was building, and Hiram had reached his limit.

He stood in the central yard, his hammer in his hand, and he spoke openly against Arpin's rule.

"This isn't right," Hiram said, his voice carrying across the yard. "This isn't how it's supposed to be. We're not slaves. We're not property. We're people, and we deserve better than this."

The crowd gathered, drawn by the sound of his voice, by the way he stood there, unafraid. Taman watched from the edge, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. This was it. This was the moment when someone finally spoke the truth, when someone finally stood up.

Arpin moved through the crowd, his smile gone, replaced by something cold and hard. Isaac followed behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"Hiram," Arpin said, his voice calm, almost reasonable. "I understand your frustration. But we have a system here. A system that works. A system that keeps everyone safe. You can't just stand there and say it's wrong without offering something better."

"It's wrong," Hiram said, his voice firm. "The ledgers are chains. The debts are cages. You're not helping us—you're binding us. And I won't stand for it anymore."

Arpin's expression shifted, and for the first time, Taman saw something dangerous in his eyes. The trader stepped forward, and before anyone could react, he struck Hiram hard across the face with the back of his hand.

The sound was sharp, like a whip crack, and Hiram staggered back, blood already welling from his lip. But Arpin wasn't done. He grabbed a piece of iron from the smith's own forge—a rod, still warm from the fire—and struck Hiram again, this time across the shoulder.

The crowd gasped as blood hit the dust, dark and sudden. Hiram dropped to one knee, his hammer falling from his hand, and the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Isaac stepped forward then, and for the first time, he pulled the coin into view. It was brass, with an off-center starburst, and it caught the light like fire. He held it up, turning it slowly, and Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made everything feel inevitable.

"Order," Isaac said, his voice carrying across the yard. "That's what we need. Order and balance. Arpin gives us that. He keeps us safe. He keeps us fed. And this man"—he pointed at Hiram, still kneeling in the dust—"this man would take that away. He would bring chaos. He would bring suffering. Is that what you want?"

The crowd was silent, watching the coin, feeling its weight. Then someone cheered—a single voice, uncertain at first, then growing. Others joined in, and soon the whole yard was filled with voices, cheering Hiram's punishment, cheering Arpin's rule, cheering the order that Isaac promised.

Taman felt sick. He wanted to rush forward, to help Hiram, to stand against this, to do something. But before he could move, Boone grabbed his arm, his grip tight.

"Don't," Boone said, his voice low, urgent. "Not now. Not like this. You'll only make it worse."

Taman looked at him, saw the fear in his eyes, saw the way he held the ledger under his arm like a shield. "He's hurt," Taman said. "We have to help him."

"We can't," Boone said. "Not now. The crowd is with Arpin. Isaac's coin has them. If we step in now, we'll be next. We have to wait. We have to be smart."

Taman wanted to argue, wanted to pull away, wanted to do something. But he saw the way the crowd was watching, the way Isaac's coin had them, the way they cheered Hiram's punishment. And he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that Boone was right. Stepping in now would only make things worse.

The missionary moved through the crowd, muttering under his breath. "Crooked scales," he said, his voice carrying in the silence between cheers. "Crooked scales call crooked ends. The weight is shifting. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

But no one was listening. The crowd was with Arpin, with Isaac, with the coin that promised order. The missionary's words were just noise, just the ramblings of a madman.

The hawk wheeled overhead, making slow, patient circles. Taman watched it, felt the weight of its attention, felt the way it marked this moment, this turning point. The bird was a witness, silent and watchful, and it saw everything—the blood in the dust, the coin in Isaac's hand, the crowd cheering, the scales tipping.

Arpin stepped forward, his expression cold. "Take him away," he said, pointing at Hiram. "Lock him up. We'll deal with him later."

Men moved forward, grabbing Hiram, dragging him away. The blacksmith didn't resist, didn't fight. He just looked at Taman, his eyes meeting Taman's for a moment, and in that look, Taman saw something—disappointment, maybe, or understanding. Then he was gone, dragged away, and the crowd began to disperse.

Taman stood there, feeling the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd done nothing. He'd stood by and watched. He'd let Boone stop him, let fear stop him, let the weight of Isaac's coin stop him. And now Hiram was gone, locked away, and the scales had tipped further, and there was nothing he could do about it.

That night, the earth trembled.

It wasn't a small shake, like before. This was something bigger, something deeper. The ground moved beneath them, and Taman felt it in his bones, felt it in the way the walls shook, felt it in the way the water buckets rattled against the wall.

It was like a beast in sleep, stirring, restless. The tremor lasted longer than any before, and when it finally stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous.

Taman sat in the dark, his hand on his pouch, feeling its familiar weight. It was still empty, but it felt heavier now, as if it was holding something he couldn't see, something that was building, accumulating, waiting.

He thought about Hiram, about the blood in the dust, about the way Isaac's coin had turned the crowd. He thought about Boone, about the way he'd stopped him, about the fear in his eyes. He thought about the missionary, about his mutterings of crooked scales, about the way no one was listening.

The scales were tipping. The weight was building. And Taman had done nothing to stop it.

The earth trembled again, a smaller shake this time, but enough to rattle the buckets, enough to remind him that the mountain was waiting, that something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
