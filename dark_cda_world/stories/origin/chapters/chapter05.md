# Chapter 5 – The First Stop

Two days after meeting Coyote, Taman found Boone at the edge of the settlement, looking over Arpin's ledgers. The sun was high overhead, and the day was warm, but Taman felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.

"We need to leave," Taman said, not bothering with pleasantries.

Boone looked up from the ledger, his expression puzzled. "Leave? Leave where?"

"East," Taman said. "Away from here. Away from Arpin, away from the ledgers, away from all of this."

Boone closed the book and set it aside. "Taman, what are you talking about? We have a good thing here. Arpin's building something, something that will last. The ledgers show it. The numbers prove it. Why would we leave?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. He'd been thinking about it since the spring, since meeting Coyote, since seeing his reflection stutter. Something was wrong. Something was building. The weight was accumulating, and he could feel it in his bones, in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited with its unmoving cloud.

"Because it's not safe," Taman said. "Because the weight is building. Because something's coming, and I don't want to be here when it arrives."

Boone shook his head. "You're worrying about nothing. The tremors? Arpin said it's just settling. The missionary? He's a madman. The ledgers? They're keeping us safe. Everything's accounted for, everything's balanced. That's how we stay safe."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the ledgers could keep them safe, that the numbers could protect them. But he'd seen how Arpin used them, how Isaac's coin bent things toward agreement, how gratitude became obligation, how debts became chains.

"It's not about the ledgers," Taman said. "It's about the weight. It's about the choices we're making, the way things are shifting. Can't you feel it? Can't you see it?"

Boone looked at him for a long moment, his expression earnest. "I see a future, Taman. I see roads and routes and wagons. I see a system that works, that keeps people safe, that gives them what they need. That's what I see. And I'm not going to walk away from that."

Taman felt the weight of it settling in. Boone wasn't going to leave. He'd made his choice, and it was bound up in the ledgers, in the numbers, in the future Arpin was promising. He couldn't see the weight building, couldn't feel the way things were shifting, because he didn't want to. The ledgers told him everything was fine, and he believed them.

"All right," Taman said. "But I'm going. With or without you."

Boone's expression shifted, became worried. "Taman, you can't. Arpin won't let you. You're part of the system now. You have obligations, debts. You can't just walk away."

Taman felt a chill run down his spine. Obligations. Debts. The words felt heavy, felt like chains. He'd been careful, had tried to stay out of Arpin's system, but maybe it was too late. Maybe he was already bound, already part of the ledger, already weighed down by choices he hadn't known he was making.

"I have to try," Taman said.

He found Arpin in the central yard, talking with Isaac. The trader looked up as Taman approached, his smile widening, but it still didn't reach his eyes.

"Taman," Arpin said. "Good to see you. I was just talking about you. We have plans, big plans, and I think you'd be perfect for them. There's a route east that needs scouting, and you're the best tracker we have. What do you say?"

Taman felt the weight of the moment pressing down. Arpin was offering him a way out, but it wasn't really a way out. It was a way to bind him tighter, to make him part of the system, to create obligations he couldn't escape.

"I want to leave," Taman said. "I want to go east, on my own. No routes, no scouting, no obligations. Just me, leaving."

Arpin's smile didn't change, but something shifted in his eyes. "I understand the desire for freedom, Taman. I really do. But you're part of this settlement now. You have responsibilities, obligations. The ledger shows it. You've received goods, credit, protection. That creates a debt, and debts need to be settled."

Taman felt the chill deepen. The ledger. The numbers. The way everything was accounted for, the way every kindness became a debt, the way every gift became a chain.

"I never asked for any of that," Taman said.

"But you received it," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "And receiving creates obligation. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair. You can't just take and leave. You have to balance the scales."

Isaac stood behind Arpin, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin. Taman felt the weight of it in the air, the way it made Arpin's words feel inevitable, the way it made the moment feel like it had already been decided.

"I'm leaving," Taman said, his voice firm.

Arpin's smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Not until your debts are settled. The ledger is clear on that. But don't worry—we can work something out. There's always a way to balance the scales."

Taman felt the weight of it pressing down. He was trapped. The ledgers had bound him, the numbers had chained him, and he couldn't escape. Not without settling debts he'd never known he was making, not without balancing scales that had been tipped without his consent.

He turned and walked away, leaving Arpin and Isaac behind. The weight was building, and he could feel it in his bones, in the way the ground-hum felt thinner, in the way the mountain waited.

That afternoon, the sky began to darken. Clouds rolled in from the west, heavy and gray, and the air grew thick with the promise of rain. By evening, the storm had arrived, and it was worse than any Taman had seen before.

The wind howled, tearing at the palisade, rattling the buildings. Rain fell in sheets, turning the ground to mud, and lightning split the sky, illuminating the settlement in flashes of white light. The thunder was constant, a low rumble that seemed to come from the earth itself.

Taman stood in the doorway of his small room, watching the storm rage. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by something else—something heavy, something dangerous. The weight was building, and the storm felt like a response, like the world was reacting to the imbalance.

The settlement hunkered down, waiting for the storm to pass. People moved through the rain, securing buildings, checking on neighbors, doing what they could to ride it out. But Taman felt the weight of it, felt the way things were shifting, felt the way the storm wasn't just weather—it was something more.

By morning, the storm had passed. The sun returned, weak and pale, and the settlement began to emerge from the wreckage. Buildings were damaged, the ground was mud, and people moved slowly, as if the storm had taken something from them.

But it was the wind that caught Taman's attention. When the sun returned, the wind carried a scent he'd never smelled before—ash. Not wood ash, not fire ash, but something else. Something that smelled of the mountain, of something deep and old and waiting.

Ash-scented wind, when there was no fire.

Taman stood in the central yard, breathing it in, and he felt the weight of it pressing down. The storm had passed, but something else was coming. The ash-scented wind was a warning, a sign that the weight was building, that the scales were tipping, that something was about to break.

The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream. And the wind carried the scent of ash, and Taman knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that this was just the beginning.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, and the scales shifted, and the weight accumulated, and something was coming.

Something that would change everything.
