# Chapter 26

Fort Shadow grew tense in the days that followed, whispers about Sela's burden spreading like wildfire, like poison, like rot, moving from person to person, voice to voice, mind to mind, the words growing, the fear spreading, the burden accumulating, the scales tipping further.

"Sela's burden poisons the fort," the whispers said. "Her gift corrupts the animals. Her burden brings sickness. Her burden shifts scales. Her gift tips balance. Her burden breaks things. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then it will poison us all. It will corrupt us all. It will break us all."

Arpin fanned the flames, holding court in the square, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, saying the mountain's anger is her fault, the tremors are her fault, the sickness is her fault, the rot is her fault, the burden is her fault, the scales tipping is her fault.

"She carries too much burden," he shouted. "More burden than any one person should carry. More burden than the fort can bear. And that burden poisons everything. It corrupts the animals. It brings sickness. It shifts scales. It tips balance. It breaks things. And the mountain responds. The mountain groans. The mountain shakes. The mountain erupts. And it's all her fault. It's all because of her burden. It's all because of her gift. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then the mountain will keep groaning, keep shaking, keep erupting, until it breaks everything, until it destroys everything, until it ends everything."

At night, men broke into Taman's cabin, their movements quick, their voices low, their hands rough, seizing Mother while Sela fled into the dark, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real.

Boone watched but did nothing, torn between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, his body still, his voice silent, his will paralyzed, caught between two burdens, two debts, two obligations, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen.

They dragged Mother into the square, her body struggling, her voice rising, her fear sharp, immediate, real, and Arpin paraded her before the town, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, saying he will "root out the curse," he will "eliminate the poison," he will "destroy the burden that poisons everything, corrupts everything, breaks everything."

"This is proof," he shouted. "This is evidence. This is what happens when burden builds too fast, when scales tip too far, when the mountain groans too loud. And I will root it out. I will eliminate it. I will destroy it. I will save you all. I will protect you all. I will ensure you all."

Taman tried to rally help, his movements urgent, his voice desperate, his words pleading, begging people to help, to protect, to stand against the cruelty, to stop the violence, to save his mother, to save Sela, to save them all.

But the townsfolk averted their eyes, their movements turning away, their voices falling silent, their wills failing, caught in fear, in debt, in obligation, unable to help, unable to protect, unable to stand against, caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of.

The missionary muttered of lambs led to slaughter, his voice low, his words careful, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more burden, more debt, more obligation.

Taman realized only he knew where Sela had hidden—a burden already bending him, a weight already pressing down, a debt already accumulating, an obligation already building, a choice already made, a path already chosen, a burden that would break him, a debt that would cost him, an obligation that would destroy him.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
