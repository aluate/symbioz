# Chapter 25

Animals fell sick in the pens that morning, their tongues swelling, their eyes clouding, their deaths quick and ugly, a reminder of the burden, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The sickness spread quickly, moving from animal to animal, pen to pen, the death quick, the suffering brief but intense, the bodies piling up, the stench growing, the burden accumulating, the scales tipping further.

Arpin blamed Sela, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, shouting that her burden poisons the fort, that her gift corrupts the animals, that her burden brings sickness, that she must be removed, must be eliminated, must be destroyed.

"She carries burden," he shouted, his voice carrying. "Too much burden. More burden than any one person should carry. More burden than the fort can bear. And that burden poisons everything. It corrupts the animals. It brings sickness. It spreads rot. And if we don't remove it, if we don't eliminate it, if we don't destroy it, then it will poison us all. It will corrupt us all. It will rot us all."

Isaac rubbed his coin, and the people nodded, some too afraid to question, others too eager to believe, their minds bending, their wills twisting, their understanding shifting, as if Sela really was the problem, as if her burden really was the poison, as if her gift really was the corruption, as if removing her would fix everything, would balance the scales, would share the burden.

Boone protested softly, his voice weak, his words careful, his will failing, saying that Sela wasn't the problem, that her gift wasn't poison, that her burden wasn't corruption, that blaming her was wrong, was cruel, was a lie.

But Arpin silenced him with a glance sharper than a blade, his eyes cold, dangerous, his expression warning, threatening, as if Boone's protest was treason, was betrayal, was something that would be punished, would be paid for, would be recorded in the ledger, would be added to his debt.

The missionary knelt by a dead calf that afternoon, his movements jerky, his voice low, his words careful, whispering "even beasts bear burden," his words chilling the mothers nearby, their voices falling silent, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if the burden was real, was immediate, was something they could feel, could see, could understand.

"Even beasts bear burden," the missionary muttered. "Even animals feel the scales tipping. Even creatures sense the mountain groaning. And when burden builds too fast, when scales tip too far, when the mountain groans too loud, even beasts die. Even animals suffer. Even creatures bear the cost. And the cost is heavy. The cost is real. The cost is paid in death, in sickness, in rot."

The hawk drifted overhead but did not cry, as if waiting, watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, patient, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come.

Sela clung to her mother that evening, her body shaking, her voice trembling, her expression frightened, as if she really was the problem, really was the poison, really was the corruption, as if removing her would fix everything, would balance the scales, would share the burden.

But her mother insisted the sickness was no girl's fault, that Sela's gift wasn't poison, that her burden wasn't corruption, that blaming her was wrong, was cruel, was a lie. But her voice trembled, her words were weak, her will was failing, and Taman felt something sink in his chest.

The sickness was real. The animals were dying. The burden was building. And blaming Sela was wrong, was cruel, was a lie. But the people believed. The coin made them believe. And belief was burden. Belief shifted scales. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

That night, ash fell on the fort though no fire burned, dusting roofs and skin like a funeral shroud, the flakes drifting down like snow, like warning, like judgment, settling on everything, covering everything, marking everything with burden, with scale, with the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The ash fell without fire, without smoke, without source, as if the mountain itself was exhaling, was responding, was preparing, as if the burden was building, the scales were tipping, the something was gathering, preparing, coming.

Taman watched the ash fall, felt it settle on his skin, tasted it in his mouth, saw it cover everything, mark everything, weight everything, and he felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift, a truth that wouldn't go away.

The sickness was real. The animals were dying. The ash was falling. The burden was building. The scales were tipping. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
