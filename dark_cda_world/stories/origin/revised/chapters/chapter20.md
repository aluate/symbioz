# Chapter 20

Supplies dwindled in the days that followed, the food running low, the tools wearing thin, the resources that had once been shared now hoarded, controlled, rationed by Arpin's ledger, bound by his debt, obligated by his terms.

The people grumbled but did not resist, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes watching, their fear growing, their will weakening, their courage failing.

They were bound. They were obligated. They were caught in chains they couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of. And resistance felt impossible. Rebellion felt like suicide. Standing against felt like standing against a mountain, like trying to stop the earth from turning, like trying to fight the burden itself.

Isaac rubbed his coin so often that even children noticed, whispering that he had luck in his pocket, that the brass piece he carried brought him power, that it gave him the ability to bend wills, to twist truth, to make people agree to things they wouldn't normally.

They didn't understand what the coin really was, what it really did, what it really meant. They just saw the power, saw the control, saw the way it bent people to Isaac's will, to Arpin's terms, to the ledger's demands.

And they whispered about it, their voices low, their words careful, their eyes watching, their fear growing, their understanding dawning—slowly, gradually, like the sun rising over the mountain, like the burden building, like the scales tipping.

Boone found Taman that morning, his expression troubled, his voice careful, his words halting, fragile.

"I think," he said, his voice low. "I think Arpin must be stopped. I think he's gone too far. I think his grip is too tight, his control too strong, his cruelty too much. I think we have to do something. I think we have to stand against him. I think we have to break free."

But his words were halting, fragile, uncertain, and Taman felt something shift, felt hope fading, felt the burden of Boone's hesitation pressing down. Boone wanted to act, wanted to stand against, wanted to break free. But his words were weak, his will was uncertain, his courage was fragile.

"Blood's heavier than ink," Taman said, his voice tight. "Family's heavier than ledger. Love's heavier than debt. And if we don't stand against Arpin, if we don't break free, if we don't choose courage over survival, then we're complicit. We're part of the problem. We're part of the cruelty, the tyranny, the burden that's crushing everyone."

Boone nodded, his expression troubled, but his silence was heavy, weighted, and Taman felt something sink in his chest. Boone wanted to act, wanted to stand against, wanted to break free. But wanting and doing were different things. And Boone's wanting felt weak, felt uncertain, felt like hope that would never be realized.

The missionary staggered into the square that afternoon, his eyes wild, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of scripture and warnings, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"The mountain is listening," he shouted, his voice carrying. "The mountain is watching. The mountain is responding to the burden, to the scales, to the choices that are being made. Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all adds burden. It all shifts scales. It all brings the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that will break, that will change, that will end everything."

He stopped, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "The mountain is listening. Can't you hear it? Can't you feel it? Can't you sense it groaning, shifting, responding to the burden, to the cruelty, to the tyranny? The mountain is alive, and it's angry, and it's responding to what you're doing, to the burden you're adding, to the scales you're tipping."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. The missionary's words were wild, mad, but they rang with a truth that made his chest ache. The mountain was listening. The mountain was responding. The mountain was groaning, shifting, building toward something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

Another tremor shook the fort then, stronger than any yet, sending shingles skittering down roofs, rattling walls, shaking the ground beneath their feet.

The tremor lasted longer than the ones before, and when it stopped, the silence that followed was heavy, dangerous, weighted with warning.

Animals panicked in their pens, their cries rising, their movements frantic, their fear growing, their understanding dawning—something was building, something was changing, something was coming.

A sickened mule dropped dead mid-bray, its body collapsing, its tongue swollen, its eyes clouded, its death quick and ugly, a reminder of the burden, of the sickness, of the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

Sela knelt beside the animal, her hands steady, her expression troubled, her burden shimmering faintly, barely visible, a sign of her gift, of her ability to hold burden, to steady it, to keep it from breaking others.

But the animal did not rise. It did not breathe. It did not move. Her gift could hold burden, but it could not bring back the dead, could not reverse what had been done, could not undo the burden that had been added, the scales that had been tipped, the something that was building, that was changing, that was coming.

The earth groaned then, a deep, rumbling sound that came from beneath them, from the mountain itself, from the burden that had been building, from the scales that had been tipping, from the something that was gathering, that was preparing, that was coming.

And the people of Fort Shadow hushed, their voices falling silent, their movements stilling, their eyes wide, their expressions frightened, as if for the first time they too could hear what Taman heard, could feel what he felt, could sense what he sensed—the mountain groaning, the burden building, the scales shifting, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

They had ignored the tremors, dismissed the warnings, laughed off the missionary's words. But this was different. This was real. This was immediate. This was the mountain itself groaning, shifting, responding to the burden, to the cruelty, to the tyranny.

And they heard it. They felt it. They sensed it. And they knew, with a certainty that made their chests tight, that something was building, something was changing, something was coming.

Something that would break. Something that would change. Something that would end everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
