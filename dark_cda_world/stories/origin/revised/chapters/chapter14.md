# Chapter 14

The eastern fort rose larger than Fort Shadow, a sprawling settlement built with care and maintained with pride. Its palisade walls stood tall and strong, but unlike Fort Shadow's walls, which seemed to lean inward with fear and oppression, these walls were marked with painted signs of welcome—patterns and symbols that spoke of openness, of community, of a place where people belonged, where they thrived, where they found balance.

Wagons moved through the gates in a steady stream, traders calling out, voices cheerful, the sound of commerce that felt different from Arpin's ledger-bound trade. Here there was barter and negotiation, but it felt fair, felt balanced, felt like both sides won, like both sides shared the burden, like both sides understood that trade was partnership, not conquest.

The missionary blathered at the gate, his voice rising in pitch, his words tumbling over each other in a rush of scripture and warnings, but the guards merely waved him through, their expressions tolerant, amused, as if he were a harmless nuisance, a madman to be tolerated but not feared.

Taman felt something ease in his chest as he passed through the gates, felt something lift from his shoulders, felt the burden shift, felt the scales balance. The air felt different here, cleaner, lighter, carrying no ash, no smoke, no warning of things to come. The ground beneath his feet felt steady, solid, as though the earth itself were balanced, as though the burden was shared, as though everything was as it should be.

The fort hummed with balance, a vibration Taman felt more than heard, a sense of rightness, of equilibrium, of burden distributed fairly, of choices made with care, of people working together instead of against each other.

Animals moved through the yards—pigs and chickens and horses—and they were fat and healthy, their coats glossy, their eyes clear, their movements steady and calm. No sick animals here. No foamed mouths. No staggering steps. No mysterious deaths. The animals thrived, and their thriving spoke of balance, of burden shared fairly, of land that was cared for, of choices that didn't break things.

Children ran between the buildings, their laughter ringing in the air, clear and joyful, the sound of play without fear, of childhood without burden, of life without the constant pressure of scales tipping, of choices breaking things. Taman watched them, and he felt something ache in his chest—a longing, a wish, a sense of what could be, of what should be, of what balance looked like when it worked.

The missionary muttered scripture beside him, but even his warnings seemed muted here, his words losing power in the face of balance, of rightness, of things being as they should be. The fort didn't need his warnings. It already understood balance. It already shared burden. It already knew what balance meant.

Mira led Taman through the settlement, her movements confident, her eyes scanning the faces, reading the signs, understanding the rhythms of the place. She knew people here, and they knew her, and there was warmth in the greetings, respect in the nods, a sense of community that Taman hadn't felt in months, hadn't felt since Arpin's arrival.

"They'll listen," Mira said, her voice low, her eyes steady. "They understand balance. They understand burden. They'll hear your story, and they'll understand what Arpin is doing, and they might help. But you need to be careful how you ask. Balance is delicate. They won't risk their own for strangers, not without good reason."

Taman nodded, understanding. Balance was delicate. Burden was shared carefully. People protected their own first, and Fort Shadow was not their own. They would listen, but they would not necessarily act, would not necessarily risk their balance for someone else's burden.

They reached a central hall, larger and more open than Fort Shadow's trading hall, and Taman saw a council gathered—traders, elders, people who moved with authority but not arrogance, who spoke with respect, who listened with care.

His mother's tribe was there too, their presence noted but not dominating, their voices heard but not demanding. They sat with the council, but their posture spoke of independence, of their own balance, of choices made on their own terms.

Mira introduced Taman, her voice clear, her words careful, and the council listened, their expressions serious, their eyes seeing something in Taman that they recognized, that they understood.

Taman spoke of Fort Shadow, of Arpin's ledgers, of the burden building, of the scales tipping, of the tremors and the ash and the sick animals. He spoke of Sela's gift, of her ability to hold burden, of how men like Arpin would hunt it, would use it, would break it. He spoke of the need for help, for balance, for a way to share the burden, to protect his sister, to save his family.

The council listened, their expressions shifting from curiosity to concern, from understanding to caution. Most dismissed him, their voices polite but firm, explaining that Fort Shadow was not their concern, that they could not risk their own balance for someone else's burden, that they had their own people to protect, their own choices to make.

But one trader stepped forward, a man with graying hair and steady eyes, his movements calm, his voice measured. "I can open a supply route," he said. "Quiet. Under the table. Goods moving west, help reaching those who need it. Not much, but something. A way to share the burden, to balance the scales a little. It won't break Arpin's grip, but it might loosen it. It might give people hope."

Taman felt something lift in his chest, felt something shift. It wasn't everything he'd hoped for, wasn't the army, wasn't the rescue, wasn't the breaking of Arpin's grip. But it was something. It was a start. It was a way to share burden, to balance scales, to give people hope.

"Thank you," he said, his voice tight with emotion. "Thank you. It's more than I hoped for. It's a start."

The trader nodded, his expression understanding. "Balance is slow, boy. Burden is shared carefully. But sometimes a little burden shared is enough to tip the scales the right way. Sometimes a little balance is enough to give people hope."

Mira pulled Taman aside as the council continued its discussion, her expression serious, her eyes seeing something he didn't want to see.

"Arpin's grip won't weaken," she said, her voice low, urgent. "Not because of supply routes. Not because of hope. He's bound people with ledgers and debt and obligation. He's made them believe they need him. He's made them afraid to leave. And as long as they're bound, as long as they're afraid, his grip stays strong."

She looked at him, her eyes kind but direct. "The only way to break his grip is to break the bindings. To get people out. To give them a place to go. To show them that balance exists elsewhere, that burden can be shared, that they don't have to live under his thumb."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Bring your family here, Taman. Bring Sela. Bring Boone. Bring your mother. Bring them east, to a place where the scales are balanced, where burden is shared, where they won't be hunted, where they can live whole. That's the only way. That's the real way to break his grip."

Taman felt something ache in his chest, a longing so sharp it hurt. He wanted that. Wanted to bring his family here, wanted to see them safe, wanted to see them whole, wanted to see them living in balance, in peace, in a place where the scales were level, where burden was shared, where they could thrive.

But he also felt the burden of impossibility, of obstacles too large to overcome, of bindings too strong to break.

"The ledgers," he said. "The debts. Arpin has them bound. They can't leave. Even if they wanted to, they can't leave."

Mira's expression softened. "The ledgers are paper, Taman. Paper and ink. They only have power if people believe in them. If people see a way out, if people see balance elsewhere, they'll find a way. They'll break free. They'll choose balance over bindings."

She looked at him, her eyes seeing deeper than he wanted them to. "But you have to show them the way. You have to give them hope. You have to plant the seed of what could be, and let it grow."

Taman felt something shift, something change. The seed of what could be. The hope of balance. The promise of a place where burden was shared, where scales were level, where they could live whole.

His mother's tribe spoke then, their voices calm, their words careful. "We will not aid Arpin," an elder said, her voice steady. "Nor will we raise hand against him. Our balance is our own. Our burden is our own. We will protect our people, and we will share burden with those who share with us, but we will not risk our balance for another's war."

Taman nodded, understanding. Their balance was their own. Their choice was their own. They would help where they could, but they would not risk everything for strangers, would not break their own balance for someone else's burden.

It was fair. It was balanced. It was what balance meant—sharing burden carefully, protecting your own, helping where you could without breaking yourself.

A sympathetic elder from the fort stepped forward, his expression kind, his eyes understanding. "You could stay here," he said. "You could make a life here. We have a place for you. A place where your sister would not be hunted, where her gift would be respected, where burden would be shared, where you could live whole."

He looked at Taman, his eyes seeing something that made his expression soften. "You've tasted balance now. You know what it feels like. You could have that. You could live that. You and your family. All of you. Safe. Whole. Balanced."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt something crack. The offer was real, was genuine, was everything he'd dreamed of. A place to stay. A place where Sela would be safe. A place where burden was shared. A place where they could live whole.

He almost said yes. Almost took it. Almost chose the peace, the balance, the safety. Almost walked away from Fort Shadow, from Arpin, from the burden, from the scales that were tipping, from the something that was coming.

But then he saw their faces in his mind—Boone, still bound to the ledgers, still believing in the system, still hoping for freedom through accounting. His mother, still at the fort, still under Arpin's thumb, still bearing the burden of choices she'd never made. Sela, still holding burden, still steadying it, still protecting others, still at risk, still hunted, still carrying a burden that would draw men like Arpin, men who would use it, break it, turn it into a weapon.

Their faces held him like a tether, pulled him back, reminded him of what he was fighting for, of who he was protecting, of why he had to go back, why he had to try, why he had to find a way to save them all.

"I can't," he said, his voice tight, his chest aching. "I can't stay. Not without them. Not while they're still there, still bound, still at risk. I have to go back. I have to find a way. I have to bring them here, to this balance, to this peace, to this place where burden is shared and scales are level."

The elder nodded, his expression understanding. "The burden follows, boy. You carry it, and you'll carry it until you share it or it breaks you. But maybe by going back, by trying, by planting the seed of what could be, you'll find a way to share it. You'll find a way to bring them here. You'll find a way to balance the scales."

Taman left the fort with provisions packed carefully, with a map marked with routes and safe places, with the bitter knowledge that he had tasted balance—and walked away from it.

The seed was planted. The hope was there. The promise of what could be. And he would carry that with him, would share it, would show his family that balance existed elsewhere, that burden could be shared, that they didn't have to live under Arpin's thumb, that they could choose a different path, a different balance, a different way.

The eastern fort faded behind him, and the road stretched ahead, leading back to Fort Shadow, back to Arpin, back to the burden, back to the scales that were tipping, back to the something that was coming.

But he carried something new now—the memory of balance, the taste of peace, the hope of what could be, the seed of a different future.

And maybe that was enough. Maybe the seed would grow. Maybe the hope would spread. Maybe he could find a way to bring them all here, to this balance, to this peace, to this place where burden was shared and scales were level.

Maybe he could find a way to save them all.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. But now he knew what balance felt like, knew what sharing burden meant, knew what they were fighting for, what they were working toward.

And that knowledge felt like a weapon, like a shield, like a way forward, like hope.
