# Chapter 3

Three days after the tremor, Taman was back in the timber, tracking sign that wouldn't commit. The ground was soft from recent rain, and the tracks were clear enough—deer, maybe, or something larger. But they kept shifting, changing direction, as if the animal couldn't decide where it wanted to go.

He crouched low, reading the ground like words. The prints were deep, well-defined, but they didn't tell a story. They moved east, then doubled back west. They circled a stand of pines, then veered north, then south again. It was as if the animal was lost, or searching for something it couldn't find.

The hawk looped overhead, making slow, patient circles. Taman watched it for a moment, then returned to the tracks. The bird had been following him all morning, its presence a constant reminder that something was watching, that something was waiting.

He followed the sign for another hour, moving through the timber with the quiet patience of a hunter. But the tracks kept shifting, kept refusing to commit to a direction. Finally, he stopped and straightened, looking up at the hawk.

"You see it too," he said, not expecting an answer.

The hawk circled once more, then drifted away, its wings catching the light. Taman watched it go, then turned back toward the settlement. The tracks weren't going to tell him anything useful. They were just marks on the ground, signs that refused to make sense.

By the time he reached the palisade, the sun was high overhead. The settlement was busy, the rhythm of the day in full swing. Taman moved through it, heading toward the central yard, where he knew he'd find Arpin.

He found the scene near the supply shed. A woman named Mary stood with her head bowed, her hands clasped in front of her. She was older, her face lined with worry, and Taman recognized her as one of the settlers who'd been struggling since Arpin's arrival.

Arpin stood before her, calm and reasonable, a ledger open in his hands. Isaac lingered at his side, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that hidden coin.

"I understand your situation, Mary," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "I really do. Times are hard, and you've been doing your best. But the ledger shows a debt, and debts need to be settled. That's how the system works. That's how we keep things fair."

Mary nodded, her shoulders slumped. "I know. I just... I don't have the means right now. My husband's been sick, and we've been using our resources to care for him. I'll pay, I promise. Just give me a little more time."

Arpin looked at her for a long moment, his expression thoughtful. Then he smiled, that smile that never reached his eyes, and closed the ledger with a soft snap.

"You know what?" he said. "I'm going to forgive this debt. Consider it a gift. You've been through enough, and I believe in helping people when they need it most. The ledger will show it as settled. You don't owe anything."

Mary's face lit up with relief. "Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know how to repay you."

Arpin reached out and gave her a fatherly pat on the shoulder. "No repayment needed. Just keep doing your best. That's all I ask."

Isaac stood behind him, one hand in his pocket, thumb working that coin. Taman watched the exchange, feeling that familiar tightness in his chest. It looked generous. It looked kind. But he'd seen this pattern before. The way Arpin forgave debts, the way he gave gifts, the way he made people feel grateful. It all created obligation. It all created Weight.

Mary walked away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted. But Taman knew that the real burden was just beginning. Now she owed Arpin something that couldn't be measured in flour or coin. She owed him gratitude, loyalty, the burden of a favor that could never be repaid.

Isaac's hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that coin, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that pressure, that wrongness—the way it made the moment feel inevitable, the way it made Mary's gratitude feel like the only possible response.

Arpin turned and saw Taman watching. His smile widened, but it still didn't reach his eyes. "Ah, Taman. Did you see that? That's how we handle things here. We help each other. We forgive debts. We make sure everyone has what they need."

Taman nodded, not trusting his voice. He wanted to say something, to point out that the debt wasn't really forgiven, that it had just been transformed into something else, something heavier. But what would he say? That he'd felt the burden of it? That he'd seen how Isaac's coin made people grateful? That would sound like madness.

"Come on," Boone said, appearing at Taman's side. "I want to show you something."

Taman let himself be led away, but his mind was still on Mary, on the way Arpin had forgiven her debt, on the way Isaac's coin had made her gratitude feel inevitable.

Boone led him to a quiet corner of the yard, where he'd set up a small table with ledgers spread across it. He sat down and opened one of the books, his expression earnest.

"Look at this," he said, pointing to a page filled with columns and numbers. "This is the settlement's future. Arpin's been planning it, mapping it out. Roads, routes, wagons. A proper trading network that connects us to other settlements, to the east, to the coast. Can you imagine it? We'd have regular supply runs, established routes, a system that works."

Taman looked at the numbers, at the neat rows and columns. He saw routes mapped out, distances calculated, costs estimated. It all looked organized, planned, safe.

"Arpin says it's the future," Boone continued, his voice excited. "He says that with proper ledgers, with proper accounting, we can build something that lasts. We can create stability, security. No more worrying about lean times, no more wondering if we'll have enough. The numbers tell us. The ledgers show us the way."

Taman wanted to believe that. He wanted to believe that the future could be mapped out in numbers, that roads and routes and wagons could create safety. But he also saw how those numbers could be used, how those routes could become chains, how that system could become a cage.

"What if people don't want to be part of it?" Taman asked.

Boone looked at him, his expression puzzled. "Why wouldn't they? It's safety. It's security. It's a future they can count on."

Taman didn't have an answer. He looked at the ledgers, at the numbers that promised safety, and he felt the burden of them pressing down. The future was being written in those books, and he wasn't sure he wanted to be part of it.

That night, Taman dreamed of the mountain.

In the dream, Olayah loomed above him, its peak hidden in cloud. But the cloud wasn't moving. It was still, unmoving, as if it had been painted there. The mountain wore it like a crown, and beneath it, the world felt wrong.

Taman stood at the base of the mountain, looking up, and he felt the burden of it pressing down. The ground-hum was gone, replaced by a silence that felt heavy, dangerous. The hawk was nowhere to be seen. The trees were still, their branches unmoving, as if they were holding their breath.

In the dream, he knew that something was coming. Something that would change everything. The mountain was waiting, the cloud was waiting, and the burden was building, accumulating, preparing to break.

He woke with a start, his heart racing, his hand already on his pouch. It felt tight, heavier than it should, as if it was holding something he couldn't see.

Outside, the settlement was quiet. The moon was high overhead, casting long shadows across the yard. The mountain Olayah loomed in the distance, its peak hidden in cloud—unmoving cloud, just like in his dream.

Taman sat up, his hand still on the pouch, and he felt the burden of the moment pressing down. The dream felt real, felt like a warning. The mountain was waiting. The cloud was waiting. And the burden was building.

He thought about the tracks that wouldn't commit, about the way the sign kept shifting, refusing to make sense. He thought about Arpin forgiving Mary's debt, about the way gratitude became obligation. He thought about Boone's future, about roads and routes and wagons, about a system that promised safety but felt like a cage.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.

And somewhere in the distance, the mountain waited, its peak hidden in unmoving cloud.
