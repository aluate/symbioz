# Chapter 31

Sela remained in hiding those days, slipping deeper into the woods, unseen, unheard, untracked, her pouch clutched tight, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her burden shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

She carried the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements slow, her steps heavy, her heart breaking, her everything broken, her burden building, her debt accumulating, her obligation growing, her something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman skulked the forest's edge those days, tormented by visions of Mother in chains, her body bound, her voice silenced, her eyes seeing him, watching him, judging him for his betrayal, for his broken trust, for his destroyed hope, for his shifted burden, for his tipped scale, for his broken balance, for his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin paraded through Shadow those days, demanding Sela, building frenzy against her, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, shouting that she must be found, must be brought back, must be given up, must be betrayed, must be broken, must be destroyed, must be ended.

"The burden must be removed," he shouted. "The poison must be eliminated. The corruption must be destroyed. The curse must be burned. The gift must be broken. The burden must be ended. And she must be found. She must be brought back. She must be given up. She must be betrayed. She must be broken. She must be destroyed. She must be ended."

Boone was torn those days, seeing Sela as a sister but feeling powerless, caught between loyalty to kin and fear of Arpin, unable to choose, unable to act, unable to do anything but watch, stand by, let it happen, bear the burden of his silence, his cowardice, his failure, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac rubbed his coin those days, whispering that the "curse" must be burned from their midst, his voice smooth, his words careful, his movements deliberate, working the brass piece in his pocket, feeling it warm under his thumb, knowing its power, its influence, its ability to bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The missionary muttered half-Bible, half-gibberish those days, confusing even himself, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more burden, more debt, more obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk hovered overhead those days, tracking both Taman and Sela, omen of balance, its movements precise, its eyes watching, seeing something that made it still, quiet, waiting, as if the balance was ready to break, as if the scales were ready to tip, as if the something was ready to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

At night, Arpin dragged Mother from her cell—his final cruelty just beginning, his movements confident, his expression satisfied, his voice loud, his words sharp, his actions deliberate, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
