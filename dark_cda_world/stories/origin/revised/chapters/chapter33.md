# Chapter 33

Taman fled to the east fort that morning, desperate for soldiers or allies to stop the sacrifice, his movements urgent, his voice tight, his words pleading, begging for help, for protection, for salvation, for something that would stop the sacrifice, that would save Sela, that would end the burden, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

The east fort thrived—animals healthy, water clear, air clean, people happy, scales balanced, burden shared, everything as it should be, everything as it could be, everything as it might have been, everything as it might still be.

But its commander refused to meddle in Shadow's self-made storm, his voice polite but firm, his words careful, his movements deliberate, saying that Fort Shadow was not their concern, that they could not risk their own balance for someone else's burden, that they had their own people to protect, their own choices to make, their own something to bear.

"We cannot meddle," the commander said, his voice careful. "We cannot interfere. We cannot risk our balance for someone else's burden. We have our own people to protect, our own choices to make, our own something to bear. And Fort Shadow? Fort Shadow made its own choices. Fort Shadow created its own burden. Fort Shadow tipped its own scales. And Fort Shadow must bear its own consequences. Fort Shadow must pay its own debt. Fort Shadow must meet its own obligation. Fort Shadow must face its own something, its own building, its own changing, its own coming."

Taman begged the missionary, who rambled of lambs, Judas, and debts unpaid, offering nothing but noise, his words tumbling, his voice rising and falling, his warnings lost in the noise, the fear, the burden, no comfort in his words, no help in his warnings, no hope in his prophecies, just more burden, more debt, more obligation, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Boone arrived secretly that evening, telling Taman that Mother is gone, and Sela will be taken within days, his voice tight, his words careful, his movements slow, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman collapsed then, his betrayal echoing Judas' thrice denial, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his burden shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his everything gone, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The hawk's shadow crossed his hands then, dark and heavy, a sign, a warning, a judgment, a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The tribe listened but held their balance, saying they will neither aid Arpin nor take up arms against him, their voice calm, their words careful, their movements deliberate, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Mercenaries already leaned Arpin's way that evening, Isaac's whispers having reached even here, his coin working its magic, bending wills, twisting truth, making people agree to things they wouldn't normally, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Taman turned back anyway, unwilling to leave Sela to the knife, his movements desperate, his voice tight, his words careful, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
