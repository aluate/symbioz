# Chapter 1

Morning broke soft over Fort Shadow, the kind that made the world feel new and the night's worries feel small. Taman moved through the timber with Sela at his side, their boots quiet on the needle-carpeted ground. The mountain Olayah loomed above them, its peak still wrapped in mist, and beneath their feet, faint sign led them in a slow, patient circle.

Taman read the ground like most men read words. An elk had passed here, maybe two hours gone. The tracks were clear enough—deep prints in the soft earth, broken twigs where it had pushed through underbrush. But something about the pattern nagged at him. The animal wasn't moving toward water or away from danger. It was just circling, lazy and deliberate, as if marking time.

"You see it too," Sela said, not a question.

Taman nodded without looking up. His sister had a way of knowing what he was thinking without him saying it. She walked a few paces behind him, letting him lead, but her presence steadied him. Always had. He felt most himself in the quiet—the hawk overhead making slow, patient loops, the pollen haze that hung in the air like gold dust, and that low ground-hum he couldn't name but had learned to trust. The vibration ran through his bootsoles, steady as a heartbeat. It meant balance was holding, things were as they should be.

The hawk circled counterclockwise, which was the way of things. Taman watched it for a moment, then returned to the tracks. The elk's path curved back on itself, a wide arc that would eventually close. He'd seen animals do strange things before—sick ones, or ones that had been spooked—but this felt different. This felt like choice.

"We should head back," Sela said. Her voice was calm, steady. She didn't need to explain why. The sun was climbing, and there was work waiting at the palisade. But more than that, she could feel the weight of the morning pressing down, the way she always could when things were about to shift.

Taman straightened and looked at her. Sela was two years older, but she carried herself like someone who'd seen twice that. Her dark hair was braided back, practical, and her hands were steady at her sides. She had a gift, their mother said, though she never called it that. Sela could hold things that would break other people. She could take the burden of a room, of a moment, of a choice, and keep it from spilling over. Taman had seen her do it a hundred times—calm a dispute, soothe a frightened child, steady a man who was about to do something he'd regret.

But gifts had costs. Taman had seen the way her hands shook sometimes, late at night when she thought no one was watching. He'd seen the way she went quiet for days after holding too much, as if the words had been pressed out of her. It left her hollow, drained, but she never complained.

"All right," he said, and they turned back toward the settlement.

The walk was quiet, companionable. Taman let his mind drift, following the hawk's lazy circles overhead. The pollen caught the light, making everything feel hazy and dreamlike. That ground-hum was still there, a vibration he felt more than heard, like the earth itself was breathing.

By the time they reached the palisade, the settlement was fully awake. The sound of a smith's hammer rang out, steady and rhythmic. Someone was sawing wood. Children's voices carried from the yard where Sela would spend her afternoon. The place had a rhythm to it, a daily dance that Taman had learned to read as well as he read tracks.

Boone was waiting for them at the gate, a ledger book tucked under his arm. He was a year older than Taman, broad-shouldered and earnest, with a way of looking at the world that made everything seem like a problem waiting to be solved. He'd taken to Arpin's ledgers like a fish to water, learning how numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

"Morning," Boone said, falling into step beside them. "Arpin wants to see you, Taman. Something about the flour distribution."

Taman felt a familiar tightness in his chest. Arpin was the trader who'd come to Fort Shadow six months ago, bringing goods and ideas that had changed everything. He was a tall man, well-dressed, with a smile that never quite reached his eyes. He kept ledgers for everything—who owed what, who had credit, who was in good standing. At first, it had seemed like a kindness, a way to help people through lean times. But Taman had watched how those numbers accumulated, how a small debt became a large one, how a favor became an obligation.

"What about the flour?" Taman asked.

Boone shrugged. "Some dispute. Isaac's handling it, but Arpin wants you there."

Isaac. Taman's jaw tightened. Arpin's right hand, a quiet man who moved through the settlement like a shadow. He had a way of making problems disappear, of smoothing over conflicts before they could really start. Taman had seen him do it a dozen times, always with one hand in his pocket, thumb working something hidden there. A coin, maybe. Taman had never seen it, but he'd felt its presence in the air, that sudden shift in the moment when people's faces went slack and their voices went agreeable. It made his gut tighten every time.

They found the scene in the central yard. A woman named Marta stood with her arms crossed, her face tight with anger. Her husband, a man named Jeb, stood beside her, looking uncomfortable. Arpin was there, calm and reasonable, and Isaac stood just behind him, one hand in his pocket.

"I'm telling you, we paid our share," Marta said, her voice rising. "We gave you three sacks last month, same as everyone else."

"And I'm not disputing that," Arpin said, his tone patient, almost fatherly. "But the ledger shows a discrepancy. According to the records, you received four sacks, not three. The extra one needs to be accounted for."

"That's not right," Jeb said, but his voice lacked conviction. He was looking at Isaac, and Isaac was just standing there, calm and still, thumb working in his pocket.

Taman watched the exchange, feeling that tightness in his chest grow. He knew Marta. She was honest, hardworking. If she said she'd given three sacks, she'd given three sacks. But Arpin's ledgers had a way of making truth feel flexible, of making people doubt what they knew.

Isaac shifted slightly, and Taman caught a glimpse of something in his pocket—a flash of brass, maybe, or the way the light caught on metal. The man's thumb was moving in a slow, circular motion. As Taman watched, he saw the tension drain out of Marta's shoulders like water from a broken bucket. Her arms uncrossed. Her face softened. Her certainty wavered, then crumbled.

"I suppose," she said slowly, voice gone placid, "if the ledger says so, then maybe I'm mistaken. It was a busy month."

Jeb looked relieved. "Right. Must have been a mistake on our part."

Arpin smiled, the kind of smile that made Taman's skin crawl. "No harm done. We'll just adjust the records. Thank you for understanding."

The matter resolved almost too quickly. One moment, Marta was angry and certain. The next, she was agreeing to something that didn't make sense. Isaac's hand stayed in his pocket the whole time, thumb working that hidden coin, and Taman felt the shift in the air—that pressure, that wrongness, the way it bent things toward agreement like a magnet pulling iron.

He wanted to say something, to step forward and point out that this wasn't right. But what would he say? That he'd seen Isaac's thumb moving? That he'd felt something in the air? That would sound like madness. And besides, Marta and Jeb were already walking away, looking relieved, as if a burden had been lifted.

Arpin turned to Taman. "Ah, there you are. I wanted to make sure you saw how we handle disputes here. Everything gets recorded, everything gets balanced. It keeps things fair."

Taman nodded, not trusting his voice. He could feel Sela beside him, steady and calm. Her presence seemed to draw the wrongness away, absorbing some of the pressure so it didn't press down on him too hard. He was grateful for that.

"Come on," Boone said, clapping Taman on the shoulder. "I'll show you how the ledgers work. It's really something, the way Arpin keeps track of everything. Makes the whole settlement run smoother."

Taman let himself be led away, but his mind stayed fixed on Isaac, on that coin in his pocket, on the way things had shifted so quickly. He'd seen it before, this pattern. Small disputes resolved too easily. People agreeing to things they shouldn't. Choices being bent, twisted, made to serve someone else's purpose. It left a sour taste in his mouth, like metal.

That night, after the settlement had quieted, Taman sat in the dark of his small room and fingered his battered pouch. It was old, hand-stitched by Sela years ago from scraps of leather and cloth. Empty, but it had a presence he'd learned to trust. When things got too heavy, when the choices piled up and threatened to break him, he could put his hand on the pouch and feel it steady him, feel it absorb some of the burden so he could breathe.

But tonight, the pouch felt different. Tighter, maybe. As if it was holding something he couldn't see. As if it was already full of tomorrow's choices.

He thought about the elk tracks, about that slow circle in the timber. He thought about Isaac's coin, about the way it made people agree. He thought about Arpin's ledgers, about how numbers could bind people tighter than rope.

The circle is only the elk's, he told himself. Not mine.

But even as he thought it, he felt the day pressing down, felt the way things were shifting. The ground-hum was still there, steady as a heartbeat, but something felt different. Thinner, maybe. As if balance was holding—but for how long?

Outside, the hawk was silent. The mountain Olayah loomed in the darkness, its peak hidden in cloud. And somewhere in the distance, Taman thought he heard the sound of scales shifting, of choices accumulating, of something building that couldn't be stopped.

He put his hand on the pouch and tried to steady himself. But the burden kept building, and he knew, with a certainty that made his chest tight, that something was coming. Something that would change everything.

The circle was closing. He could feel it.
