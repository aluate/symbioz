The eruption tore the sky that night, black smoke blotting out stars, the sound sharp, sudden, cutting through the silence like a warning, like a judgment, like a promise of things to come, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The fort shuddered then, walls crack and tumble, the ground shaking, the mountain groaning, the burden building, the scales tipping, the balance breaking, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Lava and ash roared down the slope like a living beast, the flames bright, the heat intense, the destruction complete, the burden shifted, the scale tipped, the balance broken, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Kerrick, Silas, and Marlowe fought the chaos, their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands rough, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

But their cruelty could not stop stone and fire, their weapons useless, their strength failing, their will breaking, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Hiram, Marta, and Caleb were swept aside then—virtue crushed alongside sin—their movements desperate, their voices loud, their hands reaching, their something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Arpin, screaming, clutched Isaac's coin as the heat consumed him, his movements desperate, his voice loud, his words sharp, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac laughed even as his body burned, promising he will return, his voice rising, his words sharp, his expression satisfied, his movements confident, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

"I will return," he laughed. "I will come back. I will find you. I will root you out. I will bring you back. I always do. I always work. I always bend wills, twist truth, make people agree to things they wouldn't normally. And you, boy? You will agree. You will tell. You will come back. Because I work. I always work."

Taman saw only red and gray then as the world split—his body falling one way, his name the other—the ground cracking, the sky burning, the mountain erupting, the burden shifting, the scale tipping, the balance breaking, the something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
