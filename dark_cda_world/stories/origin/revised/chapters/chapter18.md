# Chapter 18

Their mother stepped into the trading square the next morning, her movements steady, her expression firm, her voice clear as she spoke against Arpin, naming his rule cruelty in front of all.

The crowd gathered quickly, drawn by the sound of her voice, by the boldness of her words, by the sight of someone speaking truth to power, of someone naming the cruelty for what it was.

"Your ledgers are chains," she said, her voice carrying. "Your debts are bindings. Your kindness is credit, and your credit is a cage. You measure out kindness like coins, and every coin comes with a price, and every price creates a debt, and every debt binds tighter, until no one can move, until no one can breathe, until no one can escape."

She looked at Arpin directly, her eyes steady, her expression unwavering. "That's not trade. That's not fairness. That's not balance. That's cruelty. That's control. That's tyranny. And you know it. You've always known it. You've always meant it to be this way."

Arpin's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing, his hands clenching at his sides. He stepped down from his platform, his movements sharp, deliberate, dangerous.

"You speak against me," he said, his voice cold, hard. "You speak against the ledger. You speak against the system that protects you, that ensures you, that keeps you safe. You speak against order, against balance, against the way things should be."

He stepped closer, his presence large, threatening, and the crowd shifted, uneasy, sensing something building, something dangerous, something that would break.

"And when you speak against order," Arpin continued, his voice rising, "when you speak against balance, when you speak against me, you speak against yourself. You speak against the system that protects you. And that has consequences. That has a price. And that price must be paid."

He struck her then, his hand hard against her face, the sound sharp, brutal, cutting through the air like a whip.

The crowd gasped, their voices rising, their expressions shifting from curiosity to shock to anger. Someone cried out. Someone stepped forward. Someone moved to help.

But Arpin struck her again, harder this time, his blows falling heavy, brutal, unrelenting, until she staggered, until she fell, until she hit the dirt hard, her body crumpling, her face bloodied, her voice silenced.

The crowd surged forward then, their anger rising, their voices shouting, their hands reaching, their will to help, to protect, to stand against the cruelty, to stop the violence.

But Isaac stepped forward then, his hand in his pocket, his thumb working the coin, the brass warming under his touch, catching the light like fire.

He rubbed the coin in his pocket, his movements deliberate, his expression calm, and the crowd felt something shift, felt something press down, felt something squeeze.

The anger ebbed, their voices fading, their hands falling, their will weakening, their courage failing. The coin worked its magic, its power wrapping around them like chains, like bindings, like a burden that pressed down until resistance felt impossible, until help felt foolish, until standing against felt like suicide.

The crowd fell silent, their anger turning into uneasy silence, their courage turning into fear, their will to help turning into self-preservation.

Taman lunged forward then, rage hot in his throat, his hands clenched, his body moving before his mind could stop it, before he could think, before he could reason.

He would stop Arpin. He would protect his mother. He would end the violence, the cruelty, the tyranny. He would make Arpin pay, would make him suffer, would make him bleed.

But Sela's arms clamped around him before he could reach Arpin, before he could do anything, before he could make things worse.

"Don't," she said, her voice urgent, her grip tight. "Don't, Taman. Don't. If you do this, if you attack him, they'll kill you. They'll lock you away. They'll break you. And that won't help Mother. That won't change anything. That will only make things worse."

Taman struggled against her grip, his rage hot, his will strong, his body fighting, his mind screaming to break free, to act, to do something, anything, to stop the violence, to protect his mother, to make Arpin pay.

But Sela held him tight, her strength surprising, her will stronger, her voice steady. "Don't, Taman. Don't. We have to be smart. We have to be careful. We have to wait. And when the time comes, when we can act, we will. But not now. Not like this. Not when it will only make things worse."

Taman felt something break in his chest, felt something crack, felt his rage turn into something else—shame, helplessness, the bitter knowledge that he was powerless, that he couldn't help his mother, that he couldn't stop the violence, that he could only watch, only stand by, only let it happen.

Boone stood rooted in place, his expression pale, his body still, his ledger tucked under his arm like a shield he couldn't drop, like a weapon he couldn't use, like a burden he couldn't bear.

He watched Arpin strike their mother, watched the blows fall, watched her stagger, watched her fall, watched her hit the dirt, bloodied and broken.

And he did nothing.

He stood frozen, his body locked, his will paralyzed, his courage failed. He wanted to help, wanted to protect, wanted to stand against the cruelty, wanted to make Arpin pay. But his legs wouldn't move. His voice wouldn't work. His will wouldn't obey.

The ledger felt heavy in his arms, its pages pressing against his side, its numbers running through his mind, its debts and obligations weighing him down, binding him, paralyzing him.

Numbers don't lie, he'd said. Numbers show you where you stand, what you owe, what's owed to you. And he stood in debt, stood obligated, stood bound. And that debt, that obligation, that binding—it held him still, it kept him silent, it made him powerless.

He could do nothing. He would do nothing. He was bound, obligated, paralyzed by the very system he'd believed in, by the very numbers he'd trusted, by the very ledgers he'd thought would free him.

Arpin stood over their mother then, his expression cold, dangerous, his voice hard, cruel.

"Next time, woman," he growled, his words sharp, cutting. "Next time you speak against me, next time you name my rule cruelty, next time you challenge my control, I'll take more than blood. A debt's a debt, and your flesh will pay. Your family's flesh will pay. Every word, every challenge, every act of defiance—it all creates a debt. And every debt must be paid. And if you can't pay in coin, you pay in flesh. That's how it works. That's how it's always worked. And that's how it always will."

He stepped back, his movements sharp, deliberate, and the crowd shifted, uneasy, their fear growing, their will weakening, their courage failing.

The missionary moved forward then, his movements jerky, unsteady, his expression troubled, his voice rising and falling in a rhythm of broken scripture and twisted words.

He knelt beside their mother's prone form, his gaunt frame hunched, his hands shaking, his words tumbling over themselves like stones rolling downhill.

"The wages of sin," he muttered, his voice carrying. "The wages of sin is death. The wages of sin is burden. The wages of sin is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. Every sin, every choice, every burden—it all creates a debt. And every debt must be paid. And the wages of sin is burden."

He looked up, his eyes wild, haunted, seeing something that made his expression soften. "But burden is not death. Burden is not punishment. Burden is consequence. Burden is choice. Burden is what you carry, what you bear, what you tip. And sooner or later, it will all come due. Sooner or later, the burden will tell. Sooner or later, the truth will show."

Taman felt something heavy in his chest, a burden that wouldn't lift. The missionary's words were twisted, broken, but they rang with a truth that made his chest ache—the wages of sin is burden. Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all created burden. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

They carried their mother home that evening, her body bruised and broken, her face bloodied, her spirit wounded but not broken. She was hurt, but she was alive. She was beaten, but she was not defeated. She was wounded, but she would heal.

But the burden of what had happened pressed down, heavy and constant, a reminder of what Arpin could do, of what Isaac's coin could make people accept, of what happened when you spoke truth to power, when you named cruelty for what it was, when you challenged control.

That night, a tremor split a crock of water in their hut, the sound sharp and sudden, cutting through the silence like a knife.

The crock cracked, water spilling across the floor, pooling in the dirt, reflecting the dim light of the lantern, showing fractured images, broken reflections, pieces of things that didn't quite fit together.

Taman watched the water spread, felt the ground shake beneath his feet, heard the mountain groan in the distance, sensed the scales shifting, the burden building, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change everything.

He felt the scales groaning beneath his feet, felt the burden pressing down, felt the ground tremble, felt the mountain respond to the violence, to the cruelty, to the burden that had been added, to the scales that had been tipped.

Every choice, every debt, every binding—it all created burden. And every burden shifted the scales. And every shift brought the mountain closer to eruption, closer to the split, closer to the something that would break, that would change, that would end everything.

The wages of sin is burden. And the burden was heavy. And the burden was hard. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

Taman stood in the dark, clutching his pouch, feeling the burden of it, the texture of it, the reminder of what he carried, of what he bore, of what he tipped.

His mother was hurt, but she was alive. She was beaten, but she was not defeated. She was wounded, but she would heal.

But the burden remained. The scales groaned. The mountain waited. And sooner or later, it would all come due.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
