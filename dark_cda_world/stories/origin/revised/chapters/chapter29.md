# Chapter 29

Sela slipped deeper into the woods that night, unseen, unheard, untracked, carrying the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her movements desperate, her breath coming in gasps, her fear sharp, immediate, real, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her burden shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

She'd trusted him, believed in him, hoped in him, waited for him, sent him a sign, a message, a trust, believing he wouldn't betray her, wouldn't give her up, wouldn't break her, wouldn't destroy her, wouldn't end the burden, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming.

But he had. He'd betrayed her. He'd given her up. He'd broken her. He'd destroyed her. He'd led Arpin's posse to her hiding place, to her secret, to her trust, to her hope, to her everything.

And now she was alone, deeper in the woods, farther from safety, closer to danger, carrying the burden of both her gift and Taman's weakness, her trust broken, her hope destroyed, her bond severed, her burden shifted, her scale tipped, her balance broken.

Taman returned to Shadow that evening, a pariah, an outcast, a betrayer, a breaker of trust, a destroyer of hope, a shifter of scales, a tipper of balance.

The townsfolk hissed his name as traitor, their voices sharp, their words cutting, their eyes watching, their movements turning away, their trust broken, their hope destroyed, their bond severed, their burden shifted, their scale tipped, their balance broken.

"Traitor," they hissed. "Betrayer. Breaker of trust. Destroyer of hope. Shifter of scales. Tipper of balance. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her. You ended the burden, the debt, the obligation, the something that was building, changing, coming. And you will pay. You will pay for betraying. You will pay for breaking. You will pay for destroying. You will pay for shifting. You will pay for tipping. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Boone confronted him that night, fury in his voice, his words sharp, his expression dangerous, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his burden shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken.

"You sold her out," Boone shouted. "You betrayed her. You gave her up. You led them to her. You broke her. You destroyed her. And for what? For nothing. For a bargain that was broken. For a trust that was destroyed. For a hope that was gone. For a burden that was shifted. For a scale that was tipped. For a balance that was broken. And you will pay. You will pay for selling her out. You will pay for betraying her. You will pay for everything. Sooner or later, you will pay for everything."

Taman tried to explain, his voice weak, his words careful, his movements slow, his everything broken, his trust destroyed, his hope gone, his burden shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken.

But his words fell flat, hollow even in his own ears, empty, useless, meaningless, as if betrayal couldn't be explained, as if trust couldn't be restored, as if hope couldn't be regained, as if burden couldn't be unshifted, as if scale couldn't be untipped, as if balance couldn't be unbroken.

Mother, bruised and bloodied, was still not released that evening, still bound, still trapped, still caught in chains she couldn't break, couldn't escape, couldn't be free of, Arpin claiming Sela's capture is the only price, her burden the only debt, her gift the only obligation, her death the only payment, her sacrifice the only balance, her blood the only scale, her everything the only something.

The missionary clasped his Bible tighter, speaking of Judas and silver, his sermons striking too close, his words cutting, his warnings sharp, his prophecies heavy, his burden building, his debt accumulating, his obligation growing, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Isaac's coin gleamed in torchlight, as if mocking Taman, its brass surface catching the light, reflecting the flames, showing fractured images, broken reflections, pieces of things that didn't quite fit together, as if the coin saw, heard, knew, understood the betrayal, the broken trust, the destroyed hope, the shifted burden, the tipped scale, the broken balance, the something that was coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

Alone in the night, Taman fled into the woods, chasing shadows of Sela and Coyote alike, his movements desperate, his breath coming in gasps, his fear sharp, immediate, real, his trust broken, his hope destroyed, his bond severed, his burden shifted, his scale tipped, his balance broken, his something coming, something that would break, something that would change, something that would end everything.

The burden followed. The burden always followed. And sooner or later, it would all come due.
