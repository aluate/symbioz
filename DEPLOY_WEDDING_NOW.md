# Deploy Wedding Site to Vercel - RIGHT NOW

## Status
✅ Code is ready  
✅ GitHub repo exists (already connected)  
⏳ **Just needs Vercel deployment**

## Quick Deploy (Choose One)

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest - 2 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repo: `wedding`
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
4. **Root Directory:** Set to `apps/wedding`
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done! 🎉

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (3 minutes)
```bash
cd "E:\My Drive\apps\wedding"
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```
Follow the prompts - it will auto-detect everything.

### Option 3: Use Otto (if you have it set up)
The wedding site has `vercel.json` configured and ready.

## Why It's Taking So Long
The site is **100% ready** - it just hasn't been deployed yet! The code is done, it just needs someone to click "Deploy" on Vercel.

**Total time to deploy: 2-5 minutes**

---

## After Deployment
1. Site will be live at `your-app.vercel.app`
2. Add custom domain: `solsticeof26.com` (in Vercel dashboard)
3. Update DNS at your registrar

**That's it!** The frontend works perfectly - it just needs to be deployed! 🚀
