\# ALTERNATE OPENINGS



\## 1.

“Whether you just bought a house and you’re about to tear down your first wall…  

or you’re simply a human adult breathing oxygen…  

there’s some shit you’re eventually going to have to rip apart and rebuild.”



\## 2.

“Every remodel starts the same way: with a lie.  

‘It won’t be that bad.’  

Same thing with life.”



\## 3.

“I’ve opened walls in hundred-year-old homes that made more sense than some of the life choices I’ve made.”



\## 4.

“You inherit two things in life: a body and a blueprint.  

You don’t pick either one.  

But you can remodel both.”
