\# EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS



These questions help define targets, find missing parts, and get clarity.



Use them in MOVE 1 and MOVE 3.

\# TARGET-CLARITY QUESTIONS (MOVE 1)

• What does “done” actually look like?

• What problem am I trying to solve?

• What feeling am I aiming for?

• How will I know it’s finished?

• What’s the simplest version of this that would still work?

• What would “good enough” look like?

\# PARTS-IDENTIFICATION QUESTIONS (MOVE 2)

• What components make up this project?

• What’s the first small piece I can do?

• What’s missing that I need to start?

• What skills or tools would make this easier?

• What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?

\# ACQUISITION QUESTIONS (MOVE 3)

• Who has already done this?

• What do they know that I don’t?

• Who do I need to talk to?

• What information am I missing?

• What’s the fastest way to get 80% clarity?

• What would make this easier, not harder?

\# LOOP QUESTIONS (MOVE 4)

• What happened?

• What worked?

• What didn’t work?

• What needs adjusting?

• What’s the next small step?

• What can I try again?

These questions anchor the entire system. They belong on cheat sheets, in chapter callouts, and in the appendix.
