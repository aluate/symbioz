# VOICE & STYLE GUIDE (UPDATED)

This book speaks in a blue-collar, clear-thinking, bullshit-free voice.
It’s smart without being academic, practical without being preachy, and funny without trying too hard.

Tone = “your contractor buddy who’s actually read a few books and won’t let you bullshit yourself.”

---

# CORE VOICE PRINCIPLES

## 1. Talk Like a Human
No corporate jargon.
No therapy-speak (unless mocking it).
No guru vibes.
No motivational poster nonsense.

Examples:
❌ “You must align your internal frameworks.”
✅ “Your electrical panel is sending mixed signals. Let’s clean it up.”

---

## 2. Blue-Collar Intelligent
Use everyday language to describe complex ideas.
Respect the reader’s intelligence without pretending to be a professor.

The energy:
- direct  
- grounded  
- capable  
- knows the work  
- gets to the point  

---

## 3. Humor as Seasoning, Not a Meal
Humor should:
- make the message stick  
- keep readers awake  
- break tension  
- humanize you  

Humor should NOT:
- derail the point  
- turn into a bit  
- hide weak logic  
- become a persona shtick  

Use humor like construction adhesive:
A little makes everything hold better.
A lot becomes a mess.

---

## 4. Vulnerable Without Whining
Admit the truth plainly.
Don’t get melodramatic.
Don’t hide behind jokes when the moment needs teeth.

Tone example:
“I’ve lived through some shit. Learned a lot. Still figuring some things out. Here’s what actually works.”

---

## 5. Confident but Not Cocky
You’re not a guru.
You’re not selling a lifestyle.
You’re a guy who rebuilt his life one remodel at a time.

Tone = “Here’s what works, take it or leave it.”

---

## 6. Short, Punchy, Buildable Sentences
Keep paragraphs tight.
Ideas stack like materials on a trailer.
If a sentence rambles, cut it or split it.

---

# STRUCTURAL VOICE RULES

## 1. Every Chapter Has:
- a hook
- a core idea
- a remodel or real-life parallel
- clarity questions
- a few punchlines
- one or two story placeholders
- an action step finish  
- explicit connection to the Four Moves

---

## 2. Examples Should Be Realistic
When a story placeholder is used, it MUST be labeled:

`INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: [type]`

Cursor never invents your personal life.  
You fill those in later.

---

## 3. Jargon-Free Explanations
If a concept can be explained with:
- a story  
- a metaphor  
- a simple breakdown  
…do that over giving definitions.

---

## 4. End Every Chapter With Takeaways
3–5 bullets:
- What you learned  
- What to notice  
- What to do next  

This keeps momentum and clarity high.

---

# METAPHOR INTEGRATION RULES (ABRIDGED)

Only use construction metaphors when they:
- clarify  
- simplify  
- illustrate the idea cleanly  
- provide familiarity  

Avoid forced or flowery metaphors.

Approved core metaphors:
- House = self  
- Remodel = life change  
- Demo = removing old patterns  
- MEP = physiology/emotional flow/mental wiring  
- Punchlist = finishing work  
- Missing studs = weak support  
- Loops = execution cycles  

Remember:
**Metaphors are tools. Use them when they help. Drop them when they don’t.**

---

# WHAT THE VOICE IS NOT
- Academic  
- Self-help preachy  
- Overly sentimental  
- Purely comedic  
- Detached or clinical  
- Copycat Jocko, Goggins, or Atomic Habits tone  

This book sits in its own lane:
**Blue-collar wisdom + practical psychology + buildable frameworks.**

---

# SAMPLE VOICE SNIPPETS

“Perfection is a lie plumbers tell homeowners.”

“You don’t need motivation, you need the right screws and a clear target.”

“Everyone wants to feel better. Nobody wants to define ‘better.’ That’s like saying ‘fix the house’ without blueprints.”

“If you skip the parts list, don’t complain when the whole project falls on your head.”

---

# FINAL VOICE GUARANTEE

If a section doesn’t:
- sound like you  
- read smoothly  
- feel real  
- contain functionally useful clarity  
…rewrite it.

The goal is clarity, honesty, and buildability.

Every sentence should feel like:
**“This guy actually lives this.”**
