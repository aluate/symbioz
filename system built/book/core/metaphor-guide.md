\# METAPHOR GUIDE — REMODELS, HOMES, AND BUILDING



This book uses remodel/home improvement metaphors as a lens, not as a gimmick.



The metaphor should help clarify ideas, not distract from them.

\# CORE METAPHOR PRINCIPLES



\## 1. Use metaphors when they clarify real life.

Good:

“Breaking a huge task into parts is like taking apart a bathroom: plumbing, electrical, tile, paint.”



Bad:

“This relationship is like a deck board with termites chewing the screws of destiny.” (Too much.)

\## 2. The house is the self.

• Identity = the structure  

• Habits = the finishes  

• Environment = layout \& lighting  

• Physiology = MEP systems (mechanical, electrical, plumbing)  

• Emotions = water flow / pressure / leaks  

• Thought patterns = wiring routes  

• Boundaries = door seals, insulation  



Keep it natural, not overbearing.



---



\## 3. The remodel is life change.

Everyone is updating something:

• health

• finances

• work

• marriage

• identity



You make the metaphor universal by showing examples outside construction.

\## 4. Don’t stretch metaphors too long.

Use short bursts:

\- a quick parallel  

\- a story  

\- a comparison  

Then return to normal language.



---



\## 5. Use humor from the trades.

Examples:

“Previous owners always leave surprises. Same with childhood.”

“You open a wall expecting a plumbing vent, find a family of raccoons instead. Pretty much therapy.”

\# EXAMPLE ANCHOR METAPHORS (approved)



\### • Punchlist → finishing work in life

\### • Sistering joists → reinforcing weak spots

\### • Demo → removing outdated habits or roles

\### • Electrical → thoughts, impulses, mental wiring

\### • Plumbing → stress flow, emotions, pressure release

\### • Cabinets out of level → misalignment between words and actions

\### • Siding leaks → boundaries that allow chaos in

\### • Drywall dust → emotional residue from change

\### • Missing studs → lack of support or structure

\# WHEN NOT TO USE THE METAPHOR

• During deeply emotional moments that need plain language  

• When explaining universal truths better said simply  

• When it would feel gimmicky or cartoonish  

• When a simpler story works better without construction language

This guide ensures consistency and keeps the metaphor from becoming cheesy or overextended.
