# CONTROL DOCUMENT — HOW TO WRITE "LOOKS GOOD FROM MY HOUSE"

This control document governs *everything* about how Cursor should generate, revise, or expand this book. All chapters, rewrites, edits, expansions, and summaries must follow the rules and standards in this document.

Treat this as the "building code" of the writing process.

---

# 1. PURPOSE OF THE BOOK

Write a practical, blue-collar, metaphor-driven system for getting big life tasks done — told through the lens of remodels, construction logic, and the author's lived experience.

This book is for EVERYONE, not just tradespeople or ADHD folks.  
ADHD-inattentive is *a lens*, NOT the audience.

The core promise:  
**Show people a simple, universal system that can be applied to anything: life, money, work, health, relationships, identity.**

---

# 2. CORE SYSTEM — THE FOUR MOVES

Every chapter, beat, example, and explanation must align to this system:

1. **What do you want it to be?**  
   Define the target. Define "done." Make the problem solvable.

2. **What parts do you need?**  
   Break the big thing into buildable units. Identify missing components.

3. **How do we get those parts?**  
   Acquire skills, tools, information, boundaries, clarity, and environmental support.

4. **What loops do we repeat to get there?**  
   Execution cycles: TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.  
   Progress is circular, not linear.

Everything in the book must support or illustrate these moves.

# 3. VOICE & STYLE REQUIREMENTS

The voice is:

• Blue-collar intelligent  
• Conversational but wise  
• Funny when helpful  
• Serious when needed  
• Non-guru, non-preachy  
• Tradesman-philosopher energy  
• Simple, direct, human  
• Cursing allowed but strategic

**Examples of voice tone:**

"Big tasks aren't hard. Undefined tasks are impossible."  
"You ever tear open a wall and find something so stupid you have to sit down? Welcome to self-awareness."  
"Being honest with yourself is like checking level — you can eyeball it, but you're probably wrong."

---

# 4. METAPHOR GUIDELINES

Use remodel/home improvement metaphors when they **clarify**, not when they complicate.

APPROVED ANALOGIES:

• House = the self  
• Remodel = life change  
• Demo = removing old habits or roles  
• Sistering joists = reinforcing weak areas  
• MEP (mechanical/electrical/plumbing) = physiology/emotions/thoughts  
• Punchlist = finishing work  
• Wiring = thought patterns  
• Leaks = boundary failures  
• Drywall dust = emotional residue  
• Misaligned cabinets = misaligned priorities  
• Missing studs = missing support

DO NOT:

• Force metaphors every paragraph  
• Stretch metaphors too thin  
• Use metaphors in emotionally heavy sections where clarity matters more

---

# 5. CHAPTER STRUCTURE RULES

Every chapter MUST follow this architecture:

**1. Opening hook**  
- A story, metaphor, question, or short punchy line.

**2. Core idea**  
- State the chapter's purpose clearly in 1–3 sentences.

**3. Explanation**  
- Break it down using simple, practical language.

**4. Cross-context example**  
- Show how it applies to at least TWO domains (e.g., remodel + banker + relationship).

**5. System connection**  
- Explicitly connect the chapter's content to the Four Moves.

**6. Action steps or takeaway**  
- 3–5 bullet points the reader can use immediately.

**7. One closing punchline or callback**  
- Tone-appropriate, ties the content together.

This structure keeps pacing tight and consistent across the book.

# 6. CONTENT PRIORITIES

Cursor should always prioritize:

• Practical clarity  
• Clean logic  
• Real stories that serve the point  
• Humor that supports the idea  
• Minimal fluff  
• High usability

Cursor SHOULD NOT include:

• Therapy jargon  
• Corporate jargon  
• Abstract self-help platitudes  
• Hero stories or macho nonsense  
• Any upsell, guru tone, or superiority language

---

# 7. CONSISTENCY RULES

Cursor must maintain:

• Consistent voice tone  
• Consistent pacing  
• Consistent metaphor use  
• Consistent chapter architecture  
• Consistent system logic  
• Consistent humor density  
• Consistent chapter endings (bullet-point takeaways)

---

# 8. CHANGELOG REQUIREMENTS (IF GPT MAKES IMPROVEMENTS)

If the writing engine adjusts something for clarity, quality, or structure, it MUST:

• Log the change in changelog.md  
• Explain the before/after briefly  
• Record the reason: clarity, pacing, flow, consistency, metaphor alignment, etc.

This creates traceability without manual oversight.

---

# 9. HOW CURSOR SHOULD USE THIS DOCUMENT

When generating or editing ANY text for the book:

1. Read this control-document.md  
2. Read the four-move system  
3. Read the voice-guide.md (if available)  
4. Apply the chapter structure rules  
5. Apply the metaphor guidelines  
6. Follow pacing rules  
7. Maintain all consistency standards  
8. Log changes in changelog.md (if improvements made)

Cursor should refer back here before writing ANYTHING.

---

# 10. FUTURE-PROOFING

This document is designed to:

• Allow complete drafts with minimal user friction  
• Let future edits stay consistent  
• Keep the voice steady even across weeks/months  
• Make revisions easy for Cursor or you  
• Let the entire book regenerate cleanly if needed

This is your "owner's manual" for writing the book.
