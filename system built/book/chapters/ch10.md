# Chapter 10: When Things Go Wrong (And They Will)

Things will go wrong.

You'll open a wall and find rot. You'll start a project and realize you're missing critical information. You'll build a loop and discover it doesn't work. You'll acquire parts and find out they're the wrong parts.

That's not failure. That's building.

This chapter is about what to do when things go wrong.

## The First Rule: Don't Panic

When things go wrong, the first thing to do is nothing.

Don't panic. Don't give up. Don't start over. Just stop. Breathe. Assess.

Most problems aren't as bad as they seem. Most problems are solvable. But you can't solve them if you're panicking.

## The Second Rule: Use the System

When things go wrong, go back to the Four Moves.

**Move 1:** What's the actual problem? Define it clearly. Not what you think it is. What it actually is.

**Move 2:** What parts do you need to fix it? Break the problem into parts.

**Move 3:** What's missing? What do you need to acquire to fix it?

**Move 4:** What loop can you build to address it? Try, check, adjust, repeat.

The system works for problems too. Not just projects.

## Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem: You discover the target was wrong.**

**Solution:** Refine the target. Don't scrap everything. Adjust. You learned something. Use it.

**Problem: You find parts you didn't know you needed.**

**Solution:** Add them to the list. Don't treat it as failure. Treat it as discovery. Then acquire them (Move 3).

**Problem: Something you acquired doesn't work.**

**Solution:** Adjust. Try a different approach. Acquire something else. Don't give up. Pivot.

**Problem: Your loop isn't working.**

**Solution:** Check what's not working. Adjust one thing. Try again. Loops are meant to be adjusted.

**Problem: You're stuck and don't know why.**

**Solution:** Go back to Move 1. What are you actually trying to build? Is it clear? If not, define it. Then work through the moves again.

## When to Pivot vs. When to Persist

Not every problem means you should quit. Not every problem means you should persist.

**Pivot when:**
- The target doesn't actually solve the problem
- You discover what you really want is different
- The approach fundamentally won't work
- The cost (time, money, energy) exceeds the value

**Persist when:**
- You just need to adjust the approach
- You need to acquire different parts
- You need to refine the target
- You're just hitting normal friction

The difference? Pivoting means changing what you're building. Persisting means changing how you're building it.

## The "Sit Down" Moment

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: Opening a wall and finding something so stupid you have to sit down, then figuring out how to handle it.

Sometimes problems are so big you have to sit down. Literally or figuratively.

That's okay. Take a break. Assess. Then use the system.

Most problems are solvable. Even the ones that make you sit down.

---

## Learning from Problems

Problems are information.

They tell you what you didn't know. They reveal gaps in your plan. They show you what actually matters.

Don't waste that information. Use it. Adjust. Improve.

Every problem you solve makes you better at solving the next one.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

The Four Moves work for problems too.

When something goes wrong, define the problem (Move 1). Break it into parts (Move 2). Acquire what you need to fix it (Move 3). Build loops to address it (Move 4).

The system doesn't break when things go wrong. It shows you how to handle it.

## Action Steps

1. **Don't panic.** Stop. Breathe. Assess. Most problems aren't as bad as they seem.

2. **Define the actual problem.** What went wrong? Be specific. Not what you think it is. What it actually is.

3. **Use the system.** Apply the Four Moves to the problem. Break it down. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

4. **Decide: Pivot or persist?** Is the approach wrong, or just the execution? Adjust accordingly.

5. **Learn from it.** What did the problem teach you? Use that information. Don't waste it.
