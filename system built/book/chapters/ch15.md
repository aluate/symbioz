# Chapter 15: Applying the System to Relationships

Relationships are remodels. You're fixing communication. You're building connection. You're updating patterns, boundaries, understanding.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want This Relationship To Be?

**Vague:** "I want us to communicate better."

**Defined:** "I want my partner and I to have one meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll schedule it every Sunday at 7pm. We'll use a structure: each person gets five minutes to share, then we discuss."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when it's working.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Understand their needs (what do they actually need?)
- State your own needs (what do you actually need?)
- Build emotional regulation skills (so conversations don't escalate)
- Schedule regular conversations (time, structure)
- Learn to ask clarity questions (what do you mean? what do you need?)
- Build check-in loops (weekly, monthly)
- Adjust boundaries if needed
- Adjust communication patterns if needed

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know how to have structured conversations. Don't know what they actually need. Don't have emotional regulation skills.

**Acquisition:**
- Read one book on communication (library, free)
- Talk to one person who has good communication in their relationship (friend, free)
- Practice emotional regulation (breathing, pausing, free)
- Set up first scheduled conversation (free, just time)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you practice.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Weekly conversation loop:**
- Have scheduled conversation (TRY)
- Check how it went (CHECK: Did both people feel heard? What worked? What didn't?)
- Adjust structure or timing if needed (ADJUST)
- Repeat next week (REPEAT)

**Needs-check loop:**
- Ask what they need (TRY)
- Listen and clarify (CHECK: Do I understand? Do they feel heard?)
- Adjust your approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Check in again periodically (REPEAT)

**Boundary loop:**
- Try new boundary (TRY: "I need alone time on Saturdays")
- Check how it works (CHECK: Does it help? Does it cause problems?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different day? Different amount of time?)
- Maintain or refine (REPEAT)

## Common Relationship Problems

**Problem: "We don't communicate."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What would communication look like? Be specific. Then Move 4: build a communication loop. Start small. One conversation. Build from there.

**Problem: "We're always fighting."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need emotional regulation skills. And Move 4: you need loops that prevent escalation. Pause. Breathe. Schedule conversations when you're both calm.

**Problem: "I don't know what they need."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need to ask. And Move 4: build a needs-check loop. Ask. Listen. Clarify. Check in again.

**Problem: "We're growing apart."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What do you want this relationship to be? Then work through the moves. Sometimes relationships need remodels. Sometimes they need to end. The system helps you figure out which.

## The Key Insight

Relationships aren't about perfect communication. They're about systems that create connection.

Build small loops. Practice. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build relationships systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Relationships are just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your relationship target.** Be specific. What do you want this relationship to be? What does "better" mean?

2. **List the parts.** Communication? Boundaries? Understanding? What systems need building?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Skills? Knowledge? Tools? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Start with one. Weekly conversation loop. Or needs-check loop. Keep it small. Keep it moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what works for your relationship. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.
