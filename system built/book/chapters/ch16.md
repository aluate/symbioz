# Chapter 16: Applying the System to Identity

Identity is a remodel. You're updating who you are. You're building new roles. You're fixing old patterns.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Identity To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be a better person."

**Defined:** "I want to be someone who shows up consistently, keeps commitments, and treats people with respect. I want to act like that person daily, even when it's hard."

That's a target. You can measure it through actions. You can know when you're living it.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Identify current behaviors that don't match who you want to be
- Identify behaviors that do match who you want to be
- Build habits that reinforce the identity
- Adjust environment to support the identity
- Find people who reflect the identity you want
- Practice the behaviors daily
- Build identity loops (act → observe → adjust → repeat)

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one behavior.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know what behaviors match the identity. Don't have habits that reinforce it. Don't have environment that supports it.

**Acquisition:**
- Read one book on identity and habits (library, free)
- Talk to one person who embodies the identity you want (free)
- Identify one small behavior to start (free, just awareness)
- Adjust one thing in your environment (might cost money, might be free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you practice.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Identity loop:**
- Act like the person you want to be (TRY: one behavior, one day)
- Observe what happened (CHECK: Did it feel authentic? What worked? What didn't?)
- Adjust behaviors (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat daily (REPEAT)

**Habit loop:**
- Do one behavior that reinforces identity (TRY: show up on time)
- Check if you did it (CHECK: Did I do it? How did it feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different behavior? Different trigger?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Environment loop:**
- Change one thing in your environment (TRY: remove trigger for bad habit)
- Check if it helps (CHECK: Does it make the good behavior easier?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different change? More changes?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

## Common Identity Problems

**Problem: "I don't know who I want to be."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What problem are you trying to solve? What feeling are you aiming for? Define it through behaviors, not abstract concepts.

**Problem: "I keep acting like my old self."**

**Solution:** That's Move 4. Your loops aren't working. Make them smaller. Start with one behavior. One day. Build momentum. Identity is built through repeated actions.

**Problem: "My environment doesn't support who I want to be."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need to adjust your environment. And Move 4: build environment loops. Change one thing. See if it helps. Adjust. Repeat.

**Problem: "I feel like a fraud when I try to be different."**

**Solution:** That's normal. Identity change feels awkward at first. That's Move 4: keep the loop moving. Act. Observe. Adjust. Repeat. It gets more natural with practice.

## The Key Insight

Identity isn't about who you think you are. It's about who you act like.

Act like the person you want to be. Do it daily. Build loops. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build identity systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Identity is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your identity target.** Be specific. What behaviors? What actions? What does this person do daily?

2. **List the parts.** Habits? Environment? People? What systems need building?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Skills? Support? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Start with one behavior. Act like that person. Observe. Adjust. Repeat daily.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what feels authentic. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.
