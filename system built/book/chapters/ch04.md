# Chapter 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

Progress isn't linear. It's circular.

You don't build a bathroom by doing each step once and calling it done. You measure, cut, install, step back, adjust, repeat. You try something, check if it works, adjust if it doesn't, try again.

That's a loop. That's how you actually build things.

**Move 4 is about building execution cycles: TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.**

It's not about doing everything perfectly the first time. It's about doing something, seeing what happens, fixing what's wrong, and doing it again. That's how remodels work. That's how life works.

## The Core Idea

Once you know what you want (Move 1), what parts you need (Move 2), and how to get them (Move 3), you need to actually build.

But building isn't a straight line. It's a loop.

You try something. You check if it worked. You adjust what didn't work. You try again.

That's the loop. That's progress. Not doing it right the first time. Doing it, learning, adjusting, doing it better.

## Why This Matters

Most people think progress is linear. They try once. If it doesn't work, they give up. They think failure means they're doing it wrong.

But that's not how building works. Building is iterative. You try, you learn, you adjust, you try again.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A time when rebuilding routines after burnout required multiple loops, showing that progress is circular not linear.

When you build loops, you:
- Make progress even when things don't work perfectly
- Learn what actually works for you
- Adjust as you discover new information
- Build momentum through small wins
- Finish things that seemed impossible

The loop doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to keep moving.

## The Basic Loop

**TRY:** Do something. Start small. Pick one part from your list. Do it.

**CHECK:** What happened? Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Be honest.

**ADJUST:** What needs to change? What can you do differently? What did you learn?

**REPEAT:** Try again with the adjustment. Or try the next part. Keep moving.

That's it. That's the loop. Simple, but not easy.

## Loop Examples

**Remodel Loop:**
- Measure the space
- Cut the material
- Install it
- Step back and check (is it level? Does it fit?)
- Adjust if needed
- Repeat for next piece

**Health Loop:**
- Set small target (drink 60oz water today)
- Try it for three days
- Check: Did I hit it? How did I feel?
- Adjust: Too much? Too little? Wrong timing?
- Repeat with adjustment

**Relationship Loop:**
- Try new communication pattern (scheduled weekly check-in)
- Check: Did it happen? How did it feel? What worked?
- Adjust: Timing? Structure? Frequency?
- Repeat weekly

**Work Loop:**
- Try new system/process
- Review outcomes after one month
- Adjust bottlenecks or friction points
- Repeat monthly

**Identity Loop:**
- Act like the person you want to be (one behavior)
- Observe what felt authentic vs. forced
- Adjust behaviors
- Repeat daily

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 4—building loops—is how you actually execute Moves 1, 2, and 3.

You'll loop back to defining the target as you learn more. You'll loop back to identifying parts as you discover new needs. You'll loop back to acquiring parts as you find gaps.

The Four Moves aren't a linear checklist. They're a cycle. You use all of them, probably at the same time, probably more than once.

That's normal. That's how building works.

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one small thing to try.** Not the whole project. One part. One behavior. One step.

2. **Set a check-in point.** When will you check if it worked? After one day? Three days? One week?

3. **Be honest about what happened.** Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Don't sugarcoat it.

4. **Adjust one thing.** Not everything. One thing. What's the smallest change that might help?

5. **Repeat.** Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.
