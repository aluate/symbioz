# Chapter 1: What Do You Want It To Be?

You can't build what you can't see.

I've walked onto jobsites where the client said "just make it nice" and watched three different contractors interpret that three different ways. One guy thinks nice means expensive fixtures. Another thinks nice means fast. The third thinks nice means whatever he's got in the truck.

None of them are wrong. But none of them are building the same thing.

That's the problem with undefined targets. You can't measure progress. You can't know when you're done. You can't even know if you're building the right thing.

**Move 1 is about defining what "done" actually looks like.**

It's not about perfection. It's about clarity. You're not aiming for a blueprint—you're aiming for a target you can actually hit.

## The Core Idea

Before you start any big task, you need to answer one question: What do you want it to be?

Not what you think it should be. Not what someone else says it should be. What do *you* want it to be?

This question forces you to make the problem solvable. An undefined problem is impossible. A defined problem is just work.

Think about it like this: "I want to fix my finances" is impossible. "I want to have six months of expenses saved and zero credit card debt by next year" is work. The first one has no finish line. The second one has a target you can aim at.

## Why This Matters

Most people skip this step because it feels like planning, and planning feels like procrastination. They want to start doing. They want to see progress.

But here's the thing: you can't see progress if you don't know where you're going.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A remodel project that went sideways because "make it nice" was never defined, leading to scope creep and frustration.

When you don't define the target, you end up building the wrong thing. Or you build forever because there's no finish line. Or you give up because you can't tell if you're making progress.

Defining the target isn't procrastination. It's the first move. It's what makes everything else possible.

## How to Define a Target

A good target answers these questions:

**What does "done" actually look like?** Be specific. "Better" isn't done. "Six months of savings" is done.

**What problem am I trying to solve?** Not what you think the problem should be. What's actually broken?

**What feeling am I aiming for?** Sometimes the target isn't a thing—it's a feeling. "I want to feel secure about money" is a valid target. Then you figure out what that means in practice.

**How will I know it's finished?** What's the test? What's the measurement? What's the sign that says "we're done here"?

**What's the simplest version that would still work?** Don't aim for perfect. Aim for good enough. You can always improve later.

Let's see how this works in different contexts.

## Remodel Example

**Target:** "I want a functional master bathroom that doesn't leak, has good lighting, and feels clean. Budget is $15,000. Timeline is three months."

That's a target. You can measure against it. You can know when you're done. You can make decisions based on it.

Compare that to: "I want to update the bathroom."

The first one is solvable. The second one is a black hole of decisions and scope creep.

## Work Example

**Target:** "I want to transition from my current role to a project management position in the next 18 months. I need to learn three specific skills, build a portfolio of three completed projects, and network with five people in that field."

That's a target. You can break it into parts. You can measure progress. You can know when you're done.

Compare that to: "I want a better job."

The first one is work. The second one is wishful thinking.

---

## Relationship Example

**Target:** "I want my partner and I to have one meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll schedule it every Sunday at 7pm. We'll use a structure: each person gets five minutes to share, then we discuss."

That's a target. You can do it. You can check if it's working. You can adjust if it's not.

Compare that to: "I want us to communicate better."

The first one is actionable. The second one is a therapy platitude.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 1—defining the target—makes all the other moves possible.

Once you know what you want it to be, you can figure out what parts you need (Move 2). Once you know the parts, you can figure out how to get them (Move 3). Once you have the parts, you can build loops to get there (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 1, you're building in the dark. You might get lucky. But you probably won't.

The target doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be clear enough to aim at. You can always refine it as you learn more. But you can't refine what doesn't exist.

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one thing you're stuck on.** Don't try to define everything at once. Pick the thing that's causing the most friction.

2. **Write down what "done" looks like.** Be specific. Use numbers, dates, measurements. "Better" isn't specific. "Six months of savings" is.

3. **Ask yourself: What problem am I actually trying to solve?** Not what you think you should solve. What's actually broken?

4. **Define "good enough."** Not perfect. Not ideal. What's the minimum version that would still work?

5. **Write it down where you'll see it.** The target is useless if you forget it. Put it somewhere visible.

*You can't hit a target you can't see. Define the target first. Everything else comes after.*
