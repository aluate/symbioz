# Chapter 9: Building Loops That Actually Move

Loops are how you make progress.

But not all loops are created equal. Some loops spin in place. Some loops move you backward. Some loops actually move you forward.

This chapter is about building loops that work.

## What Makes a Loop Work

A working loop has four parts:

**TRY:** Do something. Start small. Pick one part. Do it.

**CHECK:** What happened? Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Be honest.

**ADJUST:** What needs to change? What can you do differently? What did you learn?

**REPEAT:** Try again with the adjustment. Or try the next part. Keep moving.

If any part is missing, the loop breaks.

## Common Loop Problems

**Problem: No CHECK.** You try things but never check if they worked. You don't know what's happening. You're building blind.

**Fix:** Set check-in points. After one day? Three days? One week? Check. Be honest about what happened.

**Problem: No ADJUST.** You check, see it's not working, but do the same thing again. The loop spins but doesn't move.

**Fix:** When something doesn't work, change something. Not everything. One thing. What's the smallest change that might help?

**Problem: No REPEAT.** You try once, it doesn't work perfectly, you give up. One loop isn't a system.

**Fix:** Loops are meant to repeat. Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.

**Problem: TRY is too big.** You try to do everything at once. It's overwhelming. You can't check or adjust because you don't know what worked.

**Fix:** Make TRY small. One part. One behavior. One step. Small enough to check and adjust.

## Loop Frequency

How often should you loop?

**Daily loops:** For habits, routines, small behaviors. Check every day. Adjust quickly.

**Weekly loops:** For systems, processes, medium-sized projects. Check once a week. Adjust as needed.

**Monthly loops:** For bigger projects, long-term goals. Check once a month. Adjust strategy.

**Project loops:** For specific tasks. Check at natural break points. Adjust before continuing.

The frequency should match the thing. Don't check daily on a year-long project. Don't check monthly on a daily habit.

## The Adjustment Principle

When something doesn't work, change something.

Not everything. One thing. The smallest change that might help.

If you're not hitting your water goal, try:
- Smaller goal? (60oz instead of 80oz)
- Different timing? (Drink in morning instead of all day)
- Different method? (Bottle instead of glass)
- Different reminder? (Alarm instead of memory)

Change one thing. See if it helps. If not, change something else.

## When Loops Reveal New Information

As you loop, you'll learn things.

You'll discover the target needs refining. You'll find parts you didn't know you needed. You'll realize you need to acquire different things.

That's normal. That's how loops work.

Loop back to earlier moves. Refine the target. Add new parts. Acquire what's missing. Then continue the loop.

---

## Momentum Through Small Wins

Loops create momentum through small wins.

Every time you complete a loop—TRY, CHECK, ADJUST, REPEAT—you've made progress. Even if the thing didn't work perfectly, you learned something. You adjusted. You're moving.

That momentum is valuable. Don't break it by trying to do everything at once.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 4—building loops—is how you execute the other moves.

You'll loop back to Move 1 (refining targets) as you learn. You'll loop back to Move 2 (discovering new parts) as you build. You'll loop back to Move 3 (acquiring more) as you find gaps.

The Four Moves aren't linear. They're a cycle. Loops keep that cycle moving.

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one small thing to try.** Not the whole project. One part. One behavior.

2. **Set a check-in point.** When will you check if it worked? Match the frequency to the thing.

3. **Be honest about what happened.** Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Don't sugarcoat it.

4. **Adjust one thing.** Not everything. One thing. The smallest change that might help.

5. **Repeat.** Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.
