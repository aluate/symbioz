# Chapter 12: Applying the System to Money

Money is just another remodel.

You're fixing something. You're building something. You're updating systems. The Four Moves work here too.

This chapter shows you how.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Money To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be financially secure."

**Defined:** "I want six months of expenses saved ($18,000), zero credit card debt ($8,000), and a system that maintains this within 18 months. I want to feel secure, not anxious, about money."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done.

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Understand current income (exact number, after taxes)
- Understand current expenses (where does money actually go?)
- List all debts (amounts, interest rates, minimum payments)
- Calculate monthly surplus or deficit
- Create emergency fund plan
- Create debt payoff plan
- Set up automation systems
- Build tracking system
- Review and adjust monthly

Each part is buildable. Each part can be checked off.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know exact expenses. Don't have tracking system. Don't know debt payoff strategies.

**Acquisition:**
- Track expenses for one month (free app or spreadsheet)
- Read one book on debt payoff (library, free)
- Talk to one person who fixed their finances (friend, free)
- Set up simple spreadsheet or free budgeting app
- Use online calculator for numbers (free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you go.

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Monthly tracking loop:**
- Track all expenses (TRY)
- Review at month end (CHECK: Where did money go? Did I hit targets?)
- Adjust budget or habits (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat next month (REPEAT)

**Debt payoff loop:**
- Pay minimums plus extra to one debt (TRY)
- Check progress after three months (CHECK: How much paid off? On track?)
- Adjust strategy if needed (ADJUST: Different debt? Different amount?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Savings loop:**
- Automate savings transfer each month (TRY)
- Check balance quarterly (CHECK: How much saved? On track?)
- Adjust amount if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different account?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

## Common Money Problems

**Problem: "I don't know where my money goes."**

**Solution:** Track for one month. That's Move 2 (identify the part) and Move 4 (build a tracking loop). Don't try to be perfect. Just track. You'll learn.

**Problem: "I have too much debt."**

**Solution:** List all debts (Move 2). Choose a payoff strategy (Move 3: acquire knowledge). Build a payoff loop (Move 4). Start with one debt. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I can't save money."**

**Solution:** Define what "saving" means (Move 1: specific target). Automate it (Move 3: acquire system). Build a savings loop (Move 4). Start small. Build the habit.

**Problem: "I'm anxious about money."**

**Solution:** Define what would make you feel secure (Move 1: target based on feeling). Build systems that create that security (Moves 2, 3, 4). Security comes from systems, not amounts.

## The Key Insight

Money management isn't about willpower. It's about systems.

Build systems (loops) that work. Automate what you can. Track what you need to. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build those systems.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Money is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your money target.** Be specific. Use numbers. What does "done" look like?

2. **List the parts.** What do you need to build? Income clarity? Expense clarity? Debt plan? Savings plan? Systems?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Tools? Systems? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Tracking loops. Payoff loops. Savings loops. Keep them moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover new parts. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.
