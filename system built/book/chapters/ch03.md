# Chapter 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

Knowing what you need doesn't mean you have it.

You can list every part of a bathroom remodel, but if you don't have the tools, the materials, the skills, or the information, you're stuck. Same with anything else. You can know exactly what parts you need for a career change, but if you don't have the skills, the network, or the clarity, you're stuck.

**Move 3 is about acquiring what's missing.**

It's not about getting everything perfect. It's about getting enough to start. You'll acquire more as you go. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

## The Core Idea

Once you know what parts you need (Move 2), you need to figure out how to get them.

Some parts you already have. Some parts you need to acquire. Some parts you need to build.

The question isn't "do I have everything?" The question is "what's the fastest way to get 80% of what I need so I can start?"

You don't need perfect tools. You need tools that work. You don't need complete information. You need enough information to make the next decision. You don't need all the skills. You need enough skills to do the next part.

## Why This Matters

Most people get stuck here because they think they need everything before they can start. They research forever. They buy all the tools. They take all the courses. Then they're too exhausted to actually build.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A project saved at the last second by asking the right question, showing how acquiring information at the right time matters more than having it all upfront.

When you focus on acquiring what you need to start, you:
- Get moving faster
- Learn what you actually need as you go
- Avoid over-preparing
- Make progress while you're still learning
- Build momentum

Acquisition isn't a one-time thing. It's ongoing. You'll need to acquire more parts as you discover new needs. That's not a failure. That's building.

## What You Might Need to Acquire

**Skills:** Can you do this? If not, who can teach you? What's the fastest way to learn enough to start?

**Tools:** Do you have what you need? If not, can you borrow? Rent? Buy the cheapest version that works?

**Information:** What do you need to know? Who knows it? What's the fastest way to get 80% clarity?

**Clarity:** Are you clear on what you're building? If not, what questions do you need answered?

**Boundaries:** Do you have the time? The space? The permission? If not, what do you need to change?

**Support:** Do you have help? Accountability? Someone to ask questions? If not, where can you find it?

**Money:** Do you have the budget? If not, what's the minimum viable version?

Let's see how this works.

## Remodel Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know current plumbing condition. Don't have tile saw. Never installed tile before.

**Acquisition:**
- Hire plumber for assessment ($200, one hour)
- Rent tile saw from hardware store ($50/day)
- Watch three YouTube videos on tile installation (free, two hours)
- Buy extra tile for practice cuts (account for waste)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you tile. You'll get better as you go. But you have enough to begin.

## Work Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know what project management actually requires. Don't have portfolio. Don't know anyone in the field.

**Acquisition:**
- Talk to three project managers (LinkedIn, coffee chats, 30 minutes each)
- Read one book on project management basics (library, free)
- Take one free online course (Coursera, free)
- Build first portfolio piece using current job projects (reframe existing work)
- Join one project management group (online or local, free or low cost)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you network. You'll build better portfolio pieces as you go. But you have enough to begin.

## Health Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know current sleep quality. Don't have movement routine. Don't know what "healthy enough" means for my body.

**Acquisition:**
- Track sleep for one week (free app, no cost)
- Talk to doctor about baseline health (insurance, one visit)
- Research one simple movement routine (walking, free)
- Define "healthy enough" based on doctor input and personal goals (clarity, free)

That's enough to start. You'll refine your definition as you go. You'll adjust your routine as you learn. But you have enough to begin.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 3—acquiring parts—makes Move 2's list actionable.

Once you have the parts (or a plan to get them), you can start building loops (Move 4). But if you skip Move 3, you're stuck with a list of things you don't have.

Acquisition doesn't have to be complete. It just has to be enough to start. You'll acquire more as you build. That's not a failure. That's how building works.

## Action Steps

1. **Identify what's missing.** Go through your parts list. What do you have? What don't you have?

2. **Find the fastest way to get 80%.** Not 100%. Not perfect. What's the minimum you need to start?

3. **Ask: Who has already done this?** Don't reinvent the wheel. Find someone who knows and ask them.

4. **Start with free or cheap.** You don't need the best tools. You need tools that work. You don't need the best course. You need enough information to start.

5. **Acquire as you go.** Don't try to get everything upfront. Get enough to start. Then get more as you need it.
