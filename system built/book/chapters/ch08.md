# Chapter 8: Acquiring What You Need (Without Over-Preparing)

Most people over-prepare and under-execute.

They research forever. They buy all the tools. They take all the courses. They read all the books. Then they're too exhausted to actually build.

**Move 3 isn't about getting everything perfect. It's about getting enough to start.**

This chapter is about acquiring what you need without getting stuck in preparation hell.

## The 80% Rule

You don't need 100% of what you need. You need 80%.

The last 20% you'll figure out as you go. You'll learn by doing. You'll acquire more as you discover gaps.

But if you wait for 100%, you'll never start.

## What Do You Actually Need?

Before you start acquiring, ask: "What's the minimum I need to start the first part?"

Not the whole project. Just the first part.

If the first part is "remove the toilet," you need:
- Basic tools (probably already have them)
- Knowledge of how to shut off water (5-minute YouTube video)
- Knowledge of how to remove a toilet (5-minute YouTube video)

That's it. You don't need to know how to install the new toilet yet. You'll learn that when you get to that part.

## Fast Acquisition Strategies

**For skills:** Find the fastest way to learn enough to start. YouTube. One book. One course. One conversation with someone who knows. Don't take five courses. Take one. Start. Learn more as you go.

**For tools:** Buy the cheapest version that works. Or borrow. Or rent. You don't need the best tools. You need tools that work. Upgrade later if you need to.

**For information:** Get 80% clarity, not 100%. Talk to one person who's done it. Read one article. Watch one video. Then start. You'll learn more as you build.

**For clarity:** Ask the questions that block you from starting. Not all the questions. Just the ones that prevent the first step.

**For support:** Find one person. Not a whole team. One person who can help, answer questions, or hold you accountable.

## When to Stop Acquiring

Stop acquiring when you have enough to start the first part.

Not when you have everything for the whole project. Not when you're an expert. When you have enough to start.

Then start. Acquire more as you need it.

## The Research Trap

Research feels productive. It feels like progress. But it's often procrastination in disguise.

Set a time limit. "I'll research for two hours, then I start." Or "I'll talk to three people, then I start." Or "I'll read one book, then I start."

Then actually start. Don't let research become an excuse to not build.

---

## Borrowing vs. Buying

You don't need to own everything.

Borrow tools. Rent equipment. Use free resources. Ask for help.

Buy only what you'll use repeatedly. For one-time use, borrow or rent.

---

## Learning as You Go

The best way to learn is by doing.

You'll learn more from installing one toilet than from watching ten videos. You'll learn more from tracking expenses for one month than from reading five finance books.

Acquire enough to start. Then learn by doing. Acquire more as you discover what you actually need.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 3—acquiring parts—makes Move 2's list actionable.

Once you have the parts (or a plan to get them), you can start building loops (Move 4). But if you skip Move 3, you're stuck with a list of things you don't have.

But don't let Move 3 become a trap. Get enough to start. Then start. Acquire more as you go.

## Action Steps

1. **Identify what's missing for the first part.** Not the whole project. Just the first part.

2. **Find the fastest way to get 80%.** Not 100%. What's the minimum you need to start?

3. **Set a time limit on research.** Two hours? One day? Then start.

4. **Borrow before buying.** For one-time use, borrow or rent. Buy only what you'll use repeatedly.

5. **Start with what you have.** Don't wait for perfect. Start. Learn. Acquire more as you go.
