# Chapter 7: Breaking Big Things Into Buildable Parts

Big things are impossible. Small things are doable.

The trick is breaking the big thing into small enough parts that you can actually build them. Not perfect parts. Not complete parts. Just parts small enough to start.

This chapter is about how to break things down without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

## The Principle

If a part feels too big, it's not a part yet. It's still a whole thing.

Keep breaking it down until you can answer: "Can I do this in one session? Or at least start it in one session?"

If the answer is no, break it down more.

## How Small Is Small Enough?

A part is small enough when:
- You can start it without needing ten other things first
- You can finish it (or make visible progress) in one work session
- You can check it off a list and feel like you accomplished something
- You know what "done" looks like for that specific part

It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be buildable.

## Examples of Breaking Down

**Too big:** "Remodel the bathroom."

**Better:** "Demo existing fixtures and tile."

**Still too big?** "Remove the toilet." "Remove the vanity." "Remove the tile from one wall."

**Too big:** "Get in shape."

**Better:** "Establish sleep routine." "Establish hydration routine." "Establish movement baseline."

**Still too big?** "Go to bed at 10pm for one week." "Drink 32oz of water before noon." "Walk 5,000 steps today."

**Too big:** "Fix my finances."

**Better:** "Track expenses for one month." "List all debts with amounts and interest rates." "Calculate monthly surplus or deficit."

**Still too big?** "Download expense tracking app." "Log expenses for one day." "List credit card debts only."

## The Order Matters (Sometimes)

Some parts have to come before others. You can't install tile before you do drywall. You can't pay off debt before you know how much you have.

But don't let order become an excuse to not start.

If you're not sure about order, ask: "What's the first thing I can do that doesn't require anything else?"

Start there. You'll figure out the order as you go.

## When Parts Reveal New Parts

As you build, you'll discover parts you didn't know you needed.

You start tiling and realize you need to fix the wall first. You start tracking expenses and realize you need to categorize them. You start a new routine and realize you need to adjust your environment.

That's normal. That's learning.

Add the new parts to your list. Don't treat them as failures. Treat them as discoveries.

---

## The "First Buildable Piece" Rule

Always identify the first thing you can actually start right now.

Not the most important thing. Not the hardest thing. The first thing you can do with what you have, where you are, right now.

Start there. Build momentum. Then tackle the next part.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 2—identifying parts—turns Move 1's target into something buildable.

Once you have parts, you can figure out what's missing (Move 3). Once you know what's missing, you can acquire it. Once you have the parts, you can build loops (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 2, you're trying to build the whole thing at once. That's how people get overwhelmed.

---

## Action Steps

1. **List all the parts you can think of.** Don't worry about order. Don't worry about completeness. Just get them down.

2. **Break down anything that feels too big.** If you can't start it in one session, break it down more.

3. **Identify the first buildable piece.** What can you start right now with what you have?

4. **Expect to discover more parts.** As you build, you'll find things you didn't know you needed. Add them to the list.

5. **Don't try to build everything at once.** Pick one part. Build it. Then pick the next part.
