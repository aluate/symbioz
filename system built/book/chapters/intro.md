# Introduction

You ever walk into a house and think, "This looks good from my house"?

That's what we say on jobsites when something's technically wrong but nobody's gonna notice from the street. It's a joke, but it's also a philosophy. Sometimes good enough is good enough. Sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the done.

This book is about getting big things done without losing your mind.

I'm not a guru. I'm a guy who's done remodels, run businesses, and rebuilt his own life more times than I care to count. I've got ADHD-inattentive, which means my brain skips steps like a bad electrical panel. That forced me to build systems that actually work—not because I'm special, but because I had to.

The system I'm giving you isn't complicated. It's four moves. That's it.

**What do you want it to be?** Define the target. Make the problem solvable.

**What parts do you need?** Break the big thing into buildable units.

**How do we get those parts?** Acquire skills, tools, information, boundaries, clarity.

**What loops do we repeat to get there?** TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.

That's the whole system. Everything else is just examples and stories.

## Why This Works

Most people fail at big tasks because they never define what "done" actually looks like. They start demo without knowing where the plumbing goes. They try to fix their finances without knowing what "fixed" means. They want to change their life without knowing what they're changing it into.

Big tasks aren't hard. Undefined tasks are impossible.

This system works because it forces you to answer the questions that matter before you start swinging a hammer. It works for remodels, sure. But it also works for money, work, health, relationships, identity—anything you're trying to build or fix.

I'll show you how a banker uses the same moves to fix a career. How a parent uses them to fix communication. How someone uses them to rebuild after burnout. Same system, different contexts.

The metaphors here are construction because that's my world. But you don't need to know a stud from a joist to use this. The metaphors are just scaffolding. The system is universal.

## What You're Getting

This book is practical, not theoretical. Every chapter gives you:

- A clear idea you can use immediately
- Examples from multiple contexts (remodel, work, life)
- Explicit connection to the Four Moves
- Action steps you can take today
- One thing to remember

No fluff. No guru bullshit. No hero stories. Just tools that work.

I'll use placeholders for some stories because I want you to see how real examples fit in. When you see "INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: [topic]," that's where a concrete example goes. The system doesn't need my specific stories to work—it needs you to see how it applies to your situation.

## How to Use This Book

Read it in order the first time. The chapters build on each other.

Then use it as a reference. Stuck on a project? Jump to the chapter about parts. Can't figure out what you're aiming for? Jump to the chapter about defining targets.

The Four Moves aren't a linear checklist. They're a cycle. You'll use all of them, probably at the same time, probably more than once. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

## The Promise

By the end of this book, you'll have a system you can apply to anything. You'll know how to break big tasks into parts. You'll know how to figure out what you're missing. You'll know how to build loops that actually move you forward.

You'll still mess up. You'll still open walls and find surprises. But you'll have a way to handle it that doesn't involve panic or giving up.

Let's build something.

**Takeaways:**

- Big tasks fail when they're undefined, not when they're hard
- The Four Moves work for anything: remodels, money, work, life
- This is a practical system, not theory
- Use the book as both a read-through and a reference
- Progress is circular, not linear—that's normal

*"Looks good from my house" means knowing when to stop perfecting and start shipping. But first, you gotta know what you're building.*
