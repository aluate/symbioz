# Chapter 13: Applying the System to Work and Career

Your career is a project. You're building something. You're fixing something. You're updating your role, your skills, your trajectory.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Career To Be?

**Vague:** "I want a better job."

**Defined:** "I want to transition from my current role to a project management position in the next 18 months. I need to learn three specific skills, build a portfolio of three completed projects, and network with five people in that field."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Research what project management actually requires
- Identify three specific skills to learn
- Find learning resources (courses, books, mentors)
- Build first project portfolio piece
- Build second project portfolio piece
- Build third project portfolio piece
- Network with five people in the field
- Update resume with new skills
- Practice interview skills
- Apply to positions
- Negotiate offers

Each part is buildable. Each part moves you forward.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know what project management requires. Don't have portfolio. Don't know anyone in the field.

**Acquisition:**
- Talk to three project managers (LinkedIn, coffee chats)
- Read one book on project management basics
- Take one free online course
- Build first portfolio piece using current job projects (reframe existing work)
- Join one project management group (online or local)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you network and build.

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Skill-building loop:**
- Learn one skill (TRY)
- Apply it to a project (CHECK: Did it work? What did I learn?)
- Adjust approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Learn next skill (REPEAT)

**Networking loop:**
- Reach out to one person per month (TRY)
- Have conversation, ask questions (CHECK: What did I learn? What connections made?)
- Adjust approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Reach out to next person (REPEAT)

**Portfolio loop:**
- Complete one project (TRY)
- Document it, add to portfolio (CHECK: Does it show the skills I need?)
- Adjust next project based on gaps (ADJUST)
- Build next project (REPEAT)

**Application loop:**
- Apply to positions (TRY)
- Track responses, interviews (CHECK: What's working? What's not?)
- Adjust resume, approach, targets (ADJUST)
- Apply again (REPEAT)

## Common Career Problems

**Problem: "I don't know what I want to do."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What problem are you trying to solve? What feeling are you aiming for? Define "better" specifically. Then work through the moves.

**Problem: "I don't have the skills."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. Identify the skills you need (Move 2). Acquire them (Move 3). Build skill-building loops (Move 4). Start with one skill. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I don't know anyone in that field."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. Network with one person (Move 4: build networking loop). They'll introduce you to others. Start small. Build connections.

**Problem: "I'm stuck in my current role."**

**Solution:** Apply the Four Moves to your current role first. What do you want it to be? What parts need to change? What do you need to acquire? What loops can you build? Sometimes fixing where you are is the path to where you want to go.

## The Key Insight

Career change isn't about one big leap. It's about building the parts: skills, portfolio, network, clarity.

Build them one at a time. Use loops to make progress. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build a career systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Work and career are just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your career target.** Be specific. What role? What skills? What timeline? What does "done" look like?

2. **List the parts.** Skills? Portfolio? Network? Resume? Interview skills? What do you need to build?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Skills? Connections? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Skill-building loops. Networking loops. Portfolio loops. Application loops. Keep them moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover new parts. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

*Your career is a project. Use the Four Moves. Build the parts. Keep the loops moving.*
