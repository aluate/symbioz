# Chapter 6: Defining Targets That Actually Work

Most targets are useless.

"I want to be successful" isn't a target. It's a wish. "I want to lose weight" isn't a target. It's a vague intention. "I want to be happy" isn't a target. It's a feeling with no definition.

A good target is specific enough to aim at. Measurable enough to know when you hit it. Realistic enough to actually achieve. And meaningful enough to matter.

This chapter is about writing targets that actually work.

## What Makes a Target Work

A working target answers five questions:

**1. What does "done" actually look like?** Be specific. Use numbers. Use dates. Use measurements.

**2. What problem am I actually solving?** Not what you think the problem should be. What's actually broken?

**3. How will I know it's finished?** What's the test? What's the sign that says "we're done here"?

**4. What's "good enough"?** Not perfect. Not ideal. What's the minimum version that would still work?

**5. Why does this matter?** If you don't care, you won't finish. What's the real reason?

## Bad Targets vs. Good Targets

**Bad:** "I want to be healthier."

**Good:** "I want to sleep 7-8 hours per night, drink 64oz of water daily, and walk 10,000 steps five days per week. I'll know it's working when I have energy throughout the day and don't crash at 3pm. Good enough means hitting 80% of these targets most weeks."

**Bad:** "I want to make more money."

**Good:** "I want to increase my income by $20,000 per year within 18 months through a combination of skill development and job change. I'll know it's done when I'm earning $X and have systems to maintain it. Good enough means $15,000 increase if the full target takes longer."

**Bad:** "I want to improve my relationship."

**Good:** "I want my partner and I to have one scheduled meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll do this every Sunday at 7pm for 30 minutes. I'll know it's working when we both look forward to it and feel closer. Good enough means we do it 3 out of 4 weeks."

## The "Good Enough" Rule

Perfect is the enemy of done.

Your target should have a "good enough" version. Not because you're lazy. Because perfect targets are impossible targets. And impossible targets lead to giving up.

Define what "good enough" looks like. Then aim for that. If you hit it early, you can always aim higher. But if you only aim for perfect, you'll never finish.

## Targets That Are Feelings

Sometimes the target isn't a thing—it's a feeling.

"I want to feel secure about money" is a valid target. But you still need to define what that means in practice.

What would make you feel secure? Six months of savings? Zero debt? A certain income level? A certain spending level?

Turn the feeling into something measurable. Then you have a target you can actually hit.

## When to Refine Targets

Targets aren't set in stone. They're starting points.

You'll learn things as you build. You'll discover what actually matters. You'll realize your original target was too vague, or too ambitious, or not ambitious enough.

That's normal. That's learning.

Refine your target when:
- You learn new information that changes what's possible
- You discover the target doesn't actually solve the problem
- You realize the target is too easy or too hard
- You find out what you really want is different

Don't refine it every week. But don't stick to a bad target just because you wrote it down.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 1—defining the target—is the foundation. If the target is bad, everything else is built on sand.

A good target makes Move 2 (parts) possible. A good target makes Move 3 (acquisition) clear. A good target makes Move 4 (loops) measurable.

But you'll loop back to Move 1 as you learn. That's normal. That's how building works.

## Action Steps

1. **Write your target.** Answer all five questions. Be specific. Use numbers.

2. **Define "good enough."** What's the minimum version that would still work?

3. **Test it:** Can you measure progress? Can you know when you're done? If not, make it more specific.

4. **Write it down where you'll see it.** Targets are useless if you forget them.

5. **Expect to refine it.** You'll learn things. You'll adjust. That's normal.

*Bad targets are wishes. Good targets are work. Write targets you can actually hit.*
