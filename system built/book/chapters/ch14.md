# Chapter 14: Applying the System to Health

Health is a remodel. You're fixing systems. You're building habits. You're updating your body, your energy, your capacity.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Health To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be healthy."

**Defined:** "I want to sleep 7-8 hours per night, have energy throughout the day without crashing, and move my body in ways that feel good five days per week. I want to feel strong and capable, not exhausted."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done (or when you're maintaining it).

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Assess current sleep quality
- Assess current hydration
- Assess current food quality
- Assess current movement level
- Set sleep target and routine
- Set hydration target and system
- Improve food quality (one meal at a time)
- Add movement baseline (walking, whatever works)
- Build consistency loops (3-day, 7-day, 30-day checks)
- Adjust environment to support habits
- Get baseline health checkup

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know current sleep quality. Don't have movement routine. Don't know what "healthy enough" means for my body.

**Acquisition:**
- Track sleep for one week (free app)
- Talk to doctor about baseline health (one visit)
- Research one simple movement routine (walking, free online)
- Define "healthy enough" based on doctor input and personal goals

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you build habits.

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Sleep loop:**
- Try new sleep routine (TRY: Go to bed at 10pm)
- Check after one week (CHECK: How do I feel? Am I hitting the target?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Earlier? Later? Different routine?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Hydration loop:**
- Try drinking 64oz water daily (TRY)
- Check after three days (CHECK: Did I hit it? How do I feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different timing?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Movement loop:**
- Try walking 5,000 steps daily (TRY)
- Check after one week (CHECK: Did I hit it? How do I feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different activity?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Food loop:**
- Try improving one meal (TRY: Better breakfast)
- Check after one week (CHECK: How do I feel? Energy? Satisfaction?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different meal? Different approach?)
- Repeat, then move to next meal (REPEAT)

## Common Health Problems

**Problem: "I don't have energy."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What would give you energy? Sleep? Food? Movement? Define it. Then work through the moves. Often it's sleep. Start there.

**Problem: "I can't stick to routines."**

**Solution:** That's Move 4. Your loops are too big or too rigid. Make them smaller. Make them more flexible. Start with one tiny loop. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I don't know where to start."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 2. Pick the easiest part. Sleep is usually easiest. Or hydration. Or a 10-minute walk. Start small. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I've tried everything and nothing works."**

**Solution:** Go back to Move 1. What are you actually trying to build? Is the target clear? Is it realistic? Then check Move 4. Are your loops too big? Are you adjusting? Are you repeating?

## The Key Insight

Health isn't about perfect habits. It's about systems that work for your life.

Build small loops. Adjust as you learn. Don't try to fix everything at once.

The Four Moves give you a way to build health systematically.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Health is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your health target.** Be specific. What does "healthy enough" mean for your life? What feeling are you aiming for?

2. **List the parts.** Sleep? Hydration? Food? Movement? What systems need building?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Baseline assessment? Tools? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Start with one. Sleep loop. Or hydration loop. Or movement loop. Keep it small. Keep it moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what works for your body. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.
