# Chapter 2: What Parts Do You Need?

You can't build a bathroom with just a hammer.

I mean, you could try. But you'd end up with a mess and a lot of broken tile. Every project needs specific parts. Tools. Materials. Skills. Information. Support.

Most people skip this step because they think they already know what they need. They don't.

**Move 2 is about breaking the big thing into buildable units and identifying what's missing.**

It's not about making a perfect list. It's about making the list good enough to start. You'll discover more parts as you go. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

## The Core Idea

Once you know what you want it to be (Move 1), you need to figure out what parts make it up.

A bathroom isn't one thing. It's demo, plumbing, electrical, drywall, tile, paint, fixtures, cleanup. Each of those is a part. Each part can be built separately. Each part has its own requirements.

The same logic applies to everything. Getting in shape isn't one thing. It's sleep, hydration, food quality, movement, consistency loops, environment support. Each of those is a part. Each part can be worked on separately.

Breaking things into parts makes them buildable. It turns an impossible task into a series of possible tasks.

## Why This Matters

Most people try to build the whole thing at once. They get overwhelmed. They don't know where to start. They give up.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A jobsite where one missing tool halted everything, showing how identifying missing parts early prevents delays.

When you break things into parts, you can:
- Start with the easiest part
- See progress immediately
- Identify what's missing before you're stuck
- Build in the right order
- Know when you're actually done

The parts don't have to be perfect. They just have to be small enough to build.

## How to Break Things Into Parts

Ask yourself these questions:

**What components make up this project?** List everything. Don't worry about order yet. Just get it all down.

**What's the first small piece I can do?** Not the most important. Not the hardest. The first thing you can actually start.

**What's missing that I need to start?** Tools? Information? Skills? Permission? Money? Clarity?

**What skills or tools would make this easier?** Not perfect. Just easier. What would remove friction?

**What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?** What do I think I know that I should actually verify?

Let's see how this works.

## Remodel Example

**Target:** Functional master bathroom, $15,000, three months.

**Parts:**
- Demo existing fixtures and tile
- Assess plumbing condition (might need updates)
- Assess electrical condition (might need updates)
- Plan layout and fixture placement
- Order materials (tile, fixtures, paint)
- Rough-in plumbing
- Rough-in electrical
- Install venting
- Drywall
- Waterproofing
- Tile installation
- Paint
- Install fixtures
- Cleanup and punchlist

That's 14 parts. Each one is buildable. Each one can be checked off. You can't build all of them at once, but you can build them one at a time.

---

## Work Example

**Target:** Transition to project management in 18 months.

**Parts:**
- Research what project management actually requires
- Identify three specific skills to learn
- Find learning resources (courses, books, mentors)
- Build first project portfolio piece
- Build second project portfolio piece
- Build third project portfolio piece
- Network with five people in the field
- Update resume with new skills
- Practice interview skills
- Apply to positions
- Negotiate offers

That's 11 parts. Each one moves you forward. Each one is doable on its own.

## Health Example

**Target:** Feel healthy enough for my life.

**Parts:**
- Assess current sleep quality
- Assess current hydration
- Assess current food quality
- Assess current movement level
- Set sleep target and routine
- Set hydration target and system
- Improve food quality (one meal at a time)
- Add movement baseline (walking, whatever)
- Build consistency loops (3-day, 7-day, 30-day checks)
- Adjust environment to support habits
- Get baseline health checkup

That's 11 parts. You don't do them all at once. You start with one. Then the next. Then the next.

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 2—identifying parts—turns Move 1's target into something buildable.

Once you know the parts, you can figure out how to get them (Move 3). Once you have the parts, you can build loops to assemble them (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 2, you're trying to build the whole thing at once. That's how people get overwhelmed. That's how projects stall.

The parts list doesn't have to be complete. It just has to be good enough to start. You'll discover more parts as you build. That's not a failure. That's learning.

## Action Steps

1. **Write down all the components.** Don't worry about order. Don't worry about completeness. Just list everything you can think of.

2. **Identify what's missing.** What do you need that you don't have? Tools? Information? Skills? Support?

3. **Find the first buildable piece.** Not the most important. Not the hardest. The first thing you can actually start right now.

4. **Don't try to build everything at once.** Pick one part. Build it. Then pick the next part.

5. **Expect to discover more parts.** As you build, you'll find things you didn't know you needed. That's normal. Add them to the list.

*You can't build what you can't break down. Break it into parts. Then build the parts.*
