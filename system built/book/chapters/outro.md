# Outro

That's the system. Four moves. That's it.

You can use it for anything. Money. Work. Health. Relationships. Identity. Remodels. Projects. Life.

Not because it's magic. Because it's how building works.

## What You Have Now

You have a system that:
- Turns impossible tasks into buildable parts
- Gives you a way to start without having everything
- Builds in learning and adjustment
- Creates momentum through loops
- Works for anything

You don't need to be perfect. You need to keep the loops moving.

## What to Do Next

Pick one thing. One project. One problem. One area of your life.

Apply the Four Moves:
1. What do you want it to be?
2. What parts do you need?
3. How do we get those parts?
4. What loops do we repeat?

Start. Build loops. Keep them moving.

Then pick the next thing.

## Remember

Big tasks aren't hard. Undefined tasks are impossible.

Progress is circular, not linear.

You don't need everything. You need enough to start.

Things will go wrong. Use the system. Fix it. Keep moving.

The system works when you use it.

## Final Thought

"Looks good from my house" means knowing when to stop perfecting and start shipping.

But first, you gotta know what you're building.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

That's how you finish.

*Let's build something.*
