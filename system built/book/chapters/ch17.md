# Chapter 17: The System Is Universal

The Four Moves work for everything.

Money. Work. Health. Relationships. Identity. Remodels. Projects. Life.

Not because the system is magic. Because the system is how building works.

This chapter is about seeing the pattern everywhere.

---

## The Pattern

**Move 1:** Define what you want it to be. Make the problem solvable.

**Move 2:** Break it into parts. Make it buildable.

**Move 3:** Acquire what's missing. Get enough to start.

**Move 4:** Build loops. TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.

That's it. That's the pattern. It works for everything because it's how building works.

---

## Why It Works

The system works because it:
- Forces you to define the problem before solving it
- Breaks impossible tasks into possible parts
- Focuses on getting enough to start, not everything perfect
- Builds in learning and adjustment through loops
- Creates momentum through small wins

It's not complicated. It's just systematic.

## The Moves Loop Back

The Four Moves aren't linear. They loop back on each other.

You'll refine the target (Move 1) as you learn. You'll discover new parts (Move 2) as you build. You'll need to acquire more (Move 3) as you find gaps. Move 4 keeps it all moving.

That's normal. That's how building works.

---

## When Things Go Wrong

When things go wrong, use the system.

Define the problem (Move 1). Break it into parts (Move 2). Acquire what you need to fix it (Move 3). Build loops to address it (Move 4).

The system works for problems too. Not just projects.

---

## The Metaphor Is Optional

The remodel metaphor helps when it clarifies. It hurts when it confuses.

Use it when it helps. Drop it when it doesn't.

The system works either way.

---

## Start Small

Don't try to fix everything at once.

Pick one thing. Apply the Four Moves. Build loops. Keep them moving.

Then pick the next thing.

---

## Keep the Loops Moving

Progress is circular, not linear.

Build loops. Keep them moving. That's how you finish.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

This whole book is the Four Moves applied to the Four Moves.

We defined what the system should be (Move 1). We broke it into parts (Move 2: four moves, examples, applications). We acquired what we needed to explain it (Move 3: stories, metaphors, clarity). We built loops to teach it (Move 4: chapters, examples, repetition).

The system explains itself.

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one thing.** Don't try to fix everything. Pick one project, one problem, one area.

2. **Apply all four moves.** Don't skip steps. Define the target. List the parts. Acquire what's missing. Build loops.

3. **Start the loops.** Don't wait for perfect. Start with what you have. Adjust as you go.

4. **Expect to loop back.** You'll refine the target. You'll discover new parts. You'll need to acquire more. That's normal.

5. **Keep the loops moving.** Progress is circular. Keep it spinning.

*The system is universal. Use it. Keep the loops moving. That's how you finish.*
