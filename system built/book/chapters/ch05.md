# Chapter 5: The System in Action

Theory is useless without practice.

You can understand the Four Moves intellectually, but until you see them work together on a real project, they're just words. Let me show you how they work in practice.

This chapter walks through one complete example from start to finish. You'll see how the moves connect. How they loop back on each other. How they turn an impossible task into something buildable.

## The Setup

Let's say you want to fix your finances. That's vague. That's impossible. Let's apply the Four Moves.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want It To Be?

**Vague target:** "I want to fix my finances."

**Defined target:** "I want to have six months of expenses saved ($18,000) and zero credit card debt ($8,000) within 18 months. I want to feel secure about money, not anxious."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done. You can make decisions based on it.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts list:**
- Understand current income (exact number, after taxes)
- Understand current expenses (where does money actually go?)
- List all debts (amounts, interest rates, minimum payments)
- Calculate monthly surplus or deficit
- Create emergency fund plan
- Create debt payoff plan
- Set up automation systems
- Build tracking system
- Review and adjust monthly

That's nine parts. Each one is buildable. Each one can be checked off.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing parts:** Don't know exact expenses. Don't have tracking system. Don't know how to prioritize debt payoff.

**Acquisition:**
- Track expenses for one month (free app or spreadsheet)
- Read one book on debt payoff strategies (library, free)
- Talk to one person who fixed their finances (friend, free)
- Set up simple spreadsheet or use free budgeting app
- Calculate numbers with online calculator (free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you go. But you have enough to begin.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Monthly loop:**
- Track expenses (TRY)
- Review at month end (CHECK: Where did money go? Did I hit targets?)
- Adjust budget or habits (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat next month (REPEAT)

**Debt payoff loop:**
- Pay minimums plus extra to one debt (TRY)
- Check progress after three months (CHECK: How much paid off? On track?)
- Adjust strategy if needed (ADJUST: Different debt? Different amount?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Savings loop:**
- Automate $500 to savings each month (TRY)
- Check balance after six months (CHECK: How much saved? On track?)
- Adjust amount if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different account?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

## How the Moves Loop Back

As you build, you'll loop back to earlier moves:

- **Loop back to Move 1:** After three months, you realize "secure about money" means something different than you thought. You refine the target.

- **Loop back to Move 2:** You discover you need a separate account for irregular expenses. You add it to the parts list.

- **Loop back to Move 3:** You realize you need better tracking tools. You acquire a different app.

- **Move 4 keeps it all moving:** The monthly loops keep you executing while you refine the other moves.

That's normal. That's how the system works.

---

## The Result

After 18 months:
- $18,000 saved (six months expenses)
- $8,000 debt paid off
- Systems in place to maintain progress
- Feeling of security, not anxiety

The target is hit. The project is done. But the loops continue because money management is ongoing.

---

## Why This Works

The Four Moves work because they:
- Turn an impossible task into buildable parts
- Give you a way to start without having everything
- Build in learning and adjustment
- Create momentum through loops
- Make progress visible

You don't need to be perfect. You need to keep the loops moving.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one project you're stuck on.** Don't try to fix everything. Pick one thing.

2. **Apply all four moves.** Don't skip steps. Define the target. List the parts. Acquire what's missing. Build loops.

3. **Start the loops.** Don't wait for perfect. Start with what you have. Adjust as you go.

4. **Expect to loop back.** You'll refine the target. You'll discover new parts. You'll need to acquire more. That's normal.

5. **Keep the loops moving.** Progress is circular. Keep it spinning.

*The system works when you use it. Apply all four moves. Keep the loops moving. That's how you finish.*
