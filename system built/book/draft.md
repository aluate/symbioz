# Looks Good From My House

# Introduction

You ever walk into a house and think, "This looks good from my house"?

That's what we say on jobsites when something's technically wrong but nobody's gonna notice from the street. It's a joke, but it's also a philosophy. Sometimes good enough is good enough. Sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the done.

This book is about getting big things done without losing your mind.

I'm not a guru. I'm a guy who's done remodels, run businesses, and rebuilt his own life more times than I care to count. I've got ADHD-inattentive, which means my brain skips steps like a bad electrical panel. That forced me to build systems that actually work—not because I'm special, but because I had to.

The system I'm giving you isn't complicated. It's four moves. That's it.

**What do you want it to be?** Define the target. Make the problem solvable.

**What parts do you need?** Break the big thing into buildable units.

**How do we get those parts?** Acquire skills, tools, information, boundaries, clarity.

**What loops do we repeat to get there?** TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.

That's the whole system. Everything else is just examples and stories.

## Why This Works

Most people fail at big tasks because they never define what "done" actually looks like. They start demo without knowing where the plumbing goes. They try to fix their finances without knowing what "fixed" means. They want to change their life without knowing what they're changing it into.

Big tasks aren't hard. Undefined tasks are impossible.

This system works because it forces you to answer the questions that matter before you start swinging a hammer. It works for remodels, sure. But it also works for money, work, health, relationships, identity—anything you're trying to build or fix.

I'll show you how a banker uses the same moves to fix a career. How a parent uses them to fix communication. How someone uses them to rebuild after burnout. Same system, different contexts.

The metaphors here are construction because that's my world. But you don't need to know a stud from a joist to use this. The metaphors are just scaffolding. The system is universal.

---

## What You're Getting

This book is practical, not theoretical. Every chapter gives you:

- A clear idea you can use immediately
- Examples from multiple contexts (remodel, work, life)
- Explicit connection to the Four Moves
- Action steps you can take today
- One thing to remember

No fluff. No guru bullshit. No hero stories. Just tools that work.

I'll use placeholders for some stories because I want you to see how real examples fit in. When you see "INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: [topic]," that's where a concrete example goes. The system doesn't need my specific stories to work—it needs you to see how it applies to your situation.

---

## How to Use This Book

Read it in order the first time. The chapters build on each other.

Then use it as a reference. Stuck on a project? Jump to the chapter about parts. Can't figure out what you're aiming for? Jump to the chapter about defining targets.

The Four Moves aren't a linear checklist. They're a cycle. You'll use all of them, probably at the same time, probably more than once. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

---

## The Promise

By the end of this book, you'll have a system you can apply to anything. You'll know how to break big tasks into parts. You'll know how to figure out what you're missing. You'll know how to build loops that actually move you forward.

You'll still mess up. You'll still open walls and find surprises. But you'll have a way to handle it that doesn't involve panic or giving up.

Let's build something.

---

**Takeaways:**

- Big tasks fail when they're undefined, not when they're hard
- The Four Moves work for anything: remodels, money, work, life
- This is a practical system, not theory
- Use the book as both a read-through and a reference
- Progress is circular, not linear—that's normal

---

*"Looks good from my house" means knowing when to stop perfecting and start shipping. But first, you gotta know what you're building.*

# Chapter 1: What Do You Want It To Be?

You can't build what you can't see.

I've walked onto jobsites where the client said "just make it nice" and watched three different contractors interpret that three different ways. One guy thinks nice means expensive fixtures. Another thinks nice means fast. The third thinks nice means whatever he's got in the truck.

None of them are wrong. But none of them are building the same thing.

That's the problem with undefined targets. You can't measure progress. You can't know when you're done. You can't even know if you're building the right thing.

**Move 1 is about defining what "done" actually looks like.**

It's not about perfection. It's about clarity. You're not aiming for a blueprint—you're aiming for a target you can actually hit.

---

## The Core Idea

Before you start any big task, you need to answer one question: What do you want it to be?

Not what you think it should be. Not what someone else says it should be. What do *you* want it to be?

This question forces you to make the problem solvable. An undefined problem is impossible. A defined problem is just work.

Think about it like this: "I want to fix my finances" is impossible. "I want to have six months of expenses saved and zero credit card debt by next year" is work. The first one has no finish line. The second one has a target you can aim at.

---

## Why This Matters

Most people skip this step because it feels like planning, and planning feels like procrastination. They want to start doing. They want to see progress.

But here's the thing: you can't see progress if you don't know where you're going.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A remodel project that went sideways because "make it nice" was never defined, leading to scope creep and frustration.

When you don't define the target, you end up building the wrong thing. Or you build forever because there's no finish line. Or you give up because you can't tell if you're making progress.

Defining the target isn't procrastination. It's the first move. It's what makes everything else possible.

---

## How to Define a Target

A good target answers these questions:

**What does "done" actually look like?** Be specific. "Better" isn't done. "Six months of savings" is done.

**What problem am I trying to solve?** Not what you think the problem should be. What's actually broken?

**What feeling am I aiming for?** Sometimes the target isn't a thing—it's a feeling. "I want to feel secure about money" is a valid target. Then you figure out what that means in practice.

**How will I know it's finished?** What's the test? What's the measurement? What's the sign that says "we're done here"?

**What's the simplest version that would still work?** Don't aim for perfect. Aim for good enough. You can always improve later.

Let's see how this works in different contexts.

---

## Remodel Example

**Target:** "I want a functional master bathroom that doesn't leak, has good lighting, and feels clean. Budget is $15,000. Timeline is three months."

That's a target. You can measure against it. You can know when you're done. You can make decisions based on it.

Compare that to: "I want to update the bathroom."

The first one is solvable. The second one is a black hole of decisions and scope creep.

---

## Work Example

**Target:** "I want to transition from my current role to a project management position in the next 18 months. I need to learn three specific skills, build a portfolio of three completed projects, and network with five people in that field."

That's a target. You can break it into parts. You can measure progress. You can know when you're done.

Compare that to: "I want a better job."

The first one is work. The second one is wishful thinking.

---

## Relationship Example

**Target:** "I want my partner and I to have one meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll schedule it every Sunday at 7pm. We'll use a structure: each person gets five minutes to share, then we discuss."

That's a target. You can do it. You can check if it's working. You can adjust if it's not.

Compare that to: "I want us to communicate better."

The first one is actionable. The second one is a therapy platitude.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 1—defining the target—makes all the other moves possible.

Once you know what you want it to be, you can figure out what parts you need (Move 2). Once you know the parts, you can figure out how to get them (Move 3). Once you have the parts, you can build loops to get there (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 1, you're building in the dark. You might get lucky. But you probably won't.

The target doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be clear enough to aim at. You can always refine it as you learn more. But you can't refine what doesn't exist.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one thing you're stuck on.** Don't try to define everything at once. Pick the thing that's causing the most friction.

2. **Write down what "done" looks like.** Be specific. Use numbers, dates, measurements. "Better" isn't specific. "Six months of savings" is.

3. **Ask yourself: What problem am I actually trying to solve?** Not what you think you should solve. What's actually broken?

4. **Define "good enough."** Not perfect. Not ideal. What's the minimum version that would still work?

5. **Write it down where you'll see it.** The target is useless if you forget it. Put it somewhere visible.

---

*You can't hit a target you can't see. Define the target first. Everything else comes after.*

# Chapter 2: What Parts Do You Need?

You can't build a bathroom with just a hammer.

I mean, you could try. But you'd end up with a mess and a lot of broken tile. Every project needs specific parts. Tools. Materials. Skills. Information. Support.

Most people skip this step because they think they already know what they need. They don't.

**Move 2 is about breaking the big thing into buildable units and identifying what's missing.**

It's not about making a perfect list. It's about making the list good enough to start. You'll discover more parts as you go. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

---

## The Core Idea

Once you know what you want it to be (Move 1), you need to figure out what parts make it up.

A bathroom isn't one thing. It's demo, plumbing, electrical, drywall, tile, paint, fixtures, cleanup. Each of those is a part. Each part can be built separately. Each part has its own requirements.

The same logic applies to everything. Getting in shape isn't one thing. It's sleep, hydration, food quality, movement, consistency loops, environment support. Each of those is a part. Each part can be worked on separately.

Breaking things into parts makes them buildable. It turns an impossible task into a series of possible tasks.

---

## Why This Matters

Most people try to build the whole thing at once. They get overwhelmed. They don't know where to start. They give up.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A jobsite where one missing tool halted everything, showing how identifying missing parts early prevents delays.

When you break things into parts, you can:
- Start with the easiest part
- See progress immediately
- Identify what's missing before you're stuck
- Build in the right order
- Know when you're actually done

The parts don't have to be perfect. They just have to be small enough to build.

---

## How to Break Things Into Parts

Ask yourself these questions:

**What components make up this project?** List everything. Don't worry about order yet. Just get it all down.

**What's the first small piece I can do?** Not the most important. Not the hardest. The first thing you can actually start.

**What's missing that I need to start?** Tools? Information? Skills? Permission? Money? Clarity?

**What skills or tools would make this easier?** Not perfect. Just easier. What would remove friction?

**What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?** What do I think I know that I should actually verify?

Let's see how this works.

---

## Remodel Example

**Target:** Functional master bathroom, $15,000, three months.

**Parts:**
- Demo existing fixtures and tile
- Assess plumbing condition (might need updates)
- Assess electrical condition (might need updates)
- Plan layout and fixture placement
- Order materials (tile, fixtures, paint)
- Rough-in plumbing
- Rough-in electrical
- Install venting
- Drywall
- Waterproofing
- Tile installation
- Paint
- Install fixtures
- Cleanup and punchlist

That's 14 parts. Each one is buildable. Each one can be checked off. You can't build all of them at once, but you can build them one at a time.

---

## Work Example

**Target:** Transition to project management in 18 months.

**Parts:**
- Research what project management actually requires
- Identify three specific skills to learn
- Find learning resources (courses, books, mentors)
- Build first project portfolio piece
- Build second project portfolio piece
- Build third project portfolio piece
- Network with five people in the field
- Update resume with new skills
- Practice interview skills
- Apply to positions
- Negotiate offers

That's 11 parts. Each one moves you forward. Each one is doable on its own.

---

## Health Example

**Target:** Feel healthy enough for my life.

**Parts:**
- Assess current sleep quality
- Assess current hydration
- Assess current food quality
- Assess current movement level
- Set sleep target and routine
- Set hydration target and system
- Improve food quality (one meal at a time)
- Add movement baseline (walking, whatever)
- Build consistency loops (3-day, 7-day, 30-day checks)
- Adjust environment to support habits
- Get baseline health checkup

That's 11 parts. You don't do them all at once. You start with one. Then the next. Then the next.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 2—identifying parts—turns Move 1's target into something buildable.

Once you know the parts, you can figure out how to get them (Move 3). Once you have the parts, you can build loops to assemble them (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 2, you're trying to build the whole thing at once. That's how people get overwhelmed. That's how projects stall.

The parts list doesn't have to be complete. It just has to be good enough to start. You'll discover more parts as you build. That's not a failure. That's learning.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Write down all the components.** Don't worry about order. Don't worry about completeness. Just list everything you can think of.

2. **Identify what's missing.** What do you need that you don't have? Tools? Information? Skills? Support?

3. **Find the first buildable piece.** Not the most important. Not the hardest. The first thing you can actually start right now.

4. **Don't try to build everything at once.** Pick one part. Build it. Then pick the next part.

5. **Expect to discover more parts.** As you build, you'll find things you didn't know you needed. That's normal. Add them to the list.

---

*You can't build what you can't break down. Break it into parts. Then build the parts.*

# Chapter 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

Knowing what you need doesn't mean you have it.

You can list every part of a bathroom remodel, but if you don't have the tools, the materials, the skills, or the information, you're stuck. Same with anything else. You can know exactly what parts you need for a career change, but if you don't have the skills, the network, or the clarity, you're stuck.

**Move 3 is about acquiring what's missing.**

It's not about getting everything perfect. It's about getting enough to start. You'll acquire more as you go. That's normal. That's how remodels work.

---

## The Core Idea

Once you know what parts you need (Move 2), you need to figure out how to get them.

Some parts you already have. Some parts you need to acquire. Some parts you need to build.

The question isn't "do I have everything?" The question is "what's the fastest way to get 80% of what I need so I can start?"

You don't need perfect tools. You need tools that work. You don't need complete information. You need enough information to make the next decision. You don't need all the skills. You need enough skills to do the next part.

---

## Why This Matters

Most people get stuck here because they think they need everything before they can start. They research forever. They buy all the tools. They take all the courses. Then they're too exhausted to actually build.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A project saved at the last second by asking the right question, showing how acquiring information at the right time matters more than having it all upfront.

When you focus on acquiring what you need to start, you:
- Get moving faster
- Learn what you actually need as you go
- Avoid over-preparing
- Make progress while you're still learning
- Build momentum

Acquisition isn't a one-time thing. It's ongoing. You'll need to acquire more parts as you discover new needs. That's not a failure. That's building.

---

## What You Might Need to Acquire

**Skills:** Can you do this? If not, who can teach you? What's the fastest way to learn enough to start?

**Tools:** Do you have what you need? If not, can you borrow? Rent? Buy the cheapest version that works?

**Information:** What do you need to know? Who knows it? What's the fastest way to get 80% clarity?

**Clarity:** Are you clear on what you're building? If not, what questions do you need answered?

**Boundaries:** Do you have the time? The space? The permission? If not, what do you need to change?

**Support:** Do you have help? Accountability? Someone to ask questions? If not, where can you find it?

**Money:** Do you have the budget? If not, what's the minimum viable version?

Let's see how this works.

---

## Remodel Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know current plumbing condition. Don't have tile saw. Never installed tile before.

**Acquisition:**
- Hire plumber for assessment ($200, one hour)
- Rent tile saw from hardware store ($50/day)
- Watch three YouTube videos on tile installation (free, two hours)
- Buy extra tile for practice cuts (account for waste)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you tile. You'll get better as you go. But you have enough to begin.

---

## Work Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know what project management actually requires. Don't have portfolio. Don't know anyone in the field.

**Acquisition:**
- Talk to three project managers (LinkedIn, coffee chats, 30 minutes each)
- Read one book on project management basics (library, free)
- Take one free online course (Coursera, free)
- Build first portfolio piece using current job projects (reframe existing work)
- Join one project management group (online or local, free or low cost)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you network. You'll build better portfolio pieces as you go. But you have enough to begin.

---

## Health Example

**Missing Parts:** Don't know current sleep quality. Don't have movement routine. Don't know what "healthy enough" means for my body.

**Acquisition:**
- Track sleep for one week (free app, no cost)
- Talk to doctor about baseline health (insurance, one visit)
- Research one simple movement routine (walking, free)
- Define "healthy enough" based on doctor input and personal goals (clarity, free)

That's enough to start. You'll refine your definition as you go. You'll adjust your routine as you learn. But you have enough to begin.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 3—acquiring parts—makes Move 2's list actionable.

Once you have the parts (or a plan to get them), you can start building loops (Move 4). But if you skip Move 3, you're stuck with a list of things you don't have.

Acquisition doesn't have to be complete. It just has to be enough to start. You'll acquire more as you build. That's not a failure. That's how building works.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Identify what's missing.** Go through your parts list. What do you have? What don't you have?

2. **Find the fastest way to get 80%.** Not 100%. Not perfect. What's the minimum you need to start?

3. **Ask: Who has already done this?** Don't reinvent the wheel. Find someone who knows and ask them.

4. **Start with free or cheap.** You don't need the best tools. You need tools that work. You don't need the best course. You need enough information to start.

5. **Acquire as you go.** Don't try to get everything upfront. Get enough to start. Then get more as you need it.

---

*You don't need everything. You need enough to start. Get that. Then get more as you go.*

# Chapter 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

Progress isn't linear. It's circular.

You don't build a bathroom by doing each step once and calling it done. You measure, cut, install, step back, adjust, repeat. You try something, check if it works, adjust if it doesn't, try again.

That's a loop. That's how you actually build things.

**Move 4 is about building execution cycles: TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.**

It's not about doing everything perfectly the first time. It's about doing something, seeing what happens, fixing what's wrong, and doing it again. That's how remodels work. That's how life works.

---

## The Core Idea

Once you know what you want (Move 1), what parts you need (Move 2), and how to get them (Move 3), you need to actually build.

But building isn't a straight line. It's a loop.

You try something. You check if it worked. You adjust what didn't work. You try again.

That's the loop. That's progress. Not doing it right the first time. Doing it, learning, adjusting, doing it better.

---

## Why This Matters

Most people think progress is linear. They try once. If it doesn't work, they give up. They think failure means they're doing it wrong.

But that's not how building works. Building is iterative. You try, you learn, you adjust, you try again.

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: A time when rebuilding routines after burnout required multiple loops, showing that progress is circular not linear.

When you build loops, you:
- Make progress even when things don't work perfectly
- Learn what actually works for you
- Adjust as you discover new information
- Build momentum through small wins
- Finish things that seemed impossible

The loop doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to keep moving.

---

## The Basic Loop

**TRY:** Do something. Start small. Pick one part from your list. Do it.

**CHECK:** What happened? Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Be honest.

**ADJUST:** What needs to change? What can you do differently? What did you learn?

**REPEAT:** Try again with the adjustment. Or try the next part. Keep moving.

That's it. That's the loop. Simple, but not easy.

---

## Loop Examples

**Remodel Loop:**
- Measure the space
- Cut the material
- Install it
- Step back and check (is it level? Does it fit?)
- Adjust if needed
- Repeat for next piece

**Health Loop:**
- Set small target (drink 60oz water today)
- Try it for three days
- Check: Did I hit it? How did I feel?
- Adjust: Too much? Too little? Wrong timing?
- Repeat with adjustment

**Relationship Loop:**
- Try new communication pattern (scheduled weekly check-in)
- Check: Did it happen? How did it feel? What worked?
- Adjust: Timing? Structure? Frequency?
- Repeat weekly

**Work Loop:**
- Try new system/process
- Review outcomes after one month
- Adjust bottlenecks or friction points
- Repeat monthly

**Identity Loop:**
- Act like the person you want to be (one behavior)
- Observe what felt authentic vs. forced
- Adjust behaviors
- Repeat daily

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 4—building loops—is how you actually execute Moves 1, 2, and 3.

You'll loop back to defining the target as you learn more. You'll loop back to identifying parts as you discover new needs. You'll loop back to acquiring parts as you find gaps.

The Four Moves aren't a linear checklist. They're a cycle. You use all of them, probably at the same time, probably more than once.

That's normal. That's how building works.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one small thing to try.** Not the whole project. One part. One behavior. One step.

2. **Set a check-in point.** When will you check if it worked? After one day? Three days? One week?

3. **Be honest about what happened.** Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Don't sugarcoat it.

4. **Adjust one thing.** Not everything. One thing. What's the smallest change that might help?

5. **Repeat.** Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.

---

*Progress is circular, not linear. Build loops. Keep them moving. That's how you finish.*

# Chapter 5: The System in Action

Theory is useless without practice.

You can understand the Four Moves intellectually, but until you see them work together on a real project, they're just words. Let me show you how they work in practice.

This chapter walks through one complete example from start to finish. You'll see how the moves connect. How they loop back on each other. How they turn an impossible task into something buildable.

---

## The Setup

Let's say you want to fix your finances. That's vague. That's impossible. Let's apply the Four Moves.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want It To Be?

**Vague target:** "I want to fix my finances."

**Defined target:** "I want to have six months of expenses saved ($18,000) and zero credit card debt ($8,000) within 18 months. I want to feel secure about money, not anxious."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done. You can make decisions based on it.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts list:**
- Understand current income (exact number, after taxes)
- Understand current expenses (where does money actually go?)
- List all debts (amounts, interest rates, minimum payments)
- Calculate monthly surplus or deficit
- Create emergency fund plan
- Create debt payoff plan
- Set up automation systems
- Build tracking system
- Review and adjust monthly

That's nine parts. Each one is buildable. Each one can be checked off.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing parts:** Don't know exact expenses. Don't have tracking system. Don't know how to prioritize debt payoff.

**Acquisition:**
- Track expenses for one month (free app or spreadsheet)
- Read one book on debt payoff strategies (library, free)
- Talk to one person who fixed their finances (friend, free)
- Set up simple spreadsheet or use free budgeting app
- Calculate numbers with online calculator (free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you go. But you have enough to begin.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Monthly loop:**
- Track expenses (TRY)
- Review at month end (CHECK: Where did money go? Did I hit targets?)
- Adjust budget or habits (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat next month (REPEAT)

**Debt payoff loop:**
- Pay minimums plus extra to one debt (TRY)
- Check progress after three months (CHECK: How much paid off? On track?)
- Adjust strategy if needed (ADJUST: Different debt? Different amount?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Savings loop:**
- Automate $500 to savings each month (TRY)
- Check balance after six months (CHECK: How much saved? On track?)
- Adjust amount if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different account?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

---

## How the Moves Loop Back

As you build, you'll loop back to earlier moves:

- **Loop back to Move 1:** After three months, you realize "secure about money" means something different than you thought. You refine the target.

- **Loop back to Move 2:** You discover you need a separate account for irregular expenses. You add it to the parts list.

- **Loop back to Move 3:** You realize you need better tracking tools. You acquire a different app.

- **Move 4 keeps it all moving:** The monthly loops keep you executing while you refine the other moves.

That's normal. That's how the system works.

---

## The Result

After 18 months:
- $18,000 saved (six months expenses)
- $8,000 debt paid off
- Systems in place to maintain progress
- Feeling of security, not anxiety

The target is hit. The project is done. But the loops continue because money management is ongoing.

---

## Why This Works

The Four Moves work because they:
- Turn an impossible task into buildable parts
- Give you a way to start without having everything
- Build in learning and adjustment
- Create momentum through loops
- Make progress visible

You don't need to be perfect. You need to keep the loops moving.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one project you're stuck on.** Don't try to fix everything. Pick one thing.

2. **Apply all four moves.** Don't skip steps. Define the target. List the parts. Acquire what's missing. Build loops.

3. **Start the loops.** Don't wait for perfect. Start with what you have. Adjust as you go.

4. **Expect to loop back.** You'll refine the target. You'll discover new parts. You'll need to acquire more. That's normal.

5. **Keep the loops moving.** Progress is circular. Keep it spinning.

---

*The system works when you use it. Apply all four moves. Keep the loops moving. That's how you finish.*

# Chapter 6: Defining Targets That Actually Work

Most targets are useless.

"I want to be successful" isn't a target. It's a wish. "I want to lose weight" isn't a target. It's a vague intention. "I want to be happy" isn't a target. It's a feeling with no definition.

A good target is specific enough to aim at. Measurable enough to know when you hit it. Realistic enough to actually achieve. And meaningful enough to matter.

This chapter is about writing targets that actually work.

---

## What Makes a Target Work

A working target answers five questions:

**1. What does "done" actually look like?** Be specific. Use numbers. Use dates. Use measurements.

**2. What problem am I actually solving?** Not what you think the problem should be. What's actually broken?

**3. How will I know it's finished?** What's the test? What's the sign that says "we're done here"?

**4. What's "good enough"?** Not perfect. Not ideal. What's the minimum version that would still work?

**5. Why does this matter?** If you don't care, you won't finish. What's the real reason?

---

## Bad Targets vs. Good Targets

**Bad:** "I want to be healthier."

**Good:** "I want to sleep 7-8 hours per night, drink 64oz of water daily, and walk 10,000 steps five days per week. I'll know it's working when I have energy throughout the day and don't crash at 3pm. Good enough means hitting 80% of these targets most weeks."

**Bad:** "I want to make more money."

**Good:** "I want to increase my income by $20,000 per year within 18 months through a combination of skill development and job change. I'll know it's done when I'm earning $X and have systems to maintain it. Good enough means $15,000 increase if the full target takes longer."

**Bad:** "I want to improve my relationship."

**Good:** "I want my partner and I to have one scheduled meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll do this every Sunday at 7pm for 30 minutes. I'll know it's working when we both look forward to it and feel closer. Good enough means we do it 3 out of 4 weeks."

---

## The "Good Enough" Rule

Perfect is the enemy of done.

Your target should have a "good enough" version. Not because you're lazy. Because perfect targets are impossible targets. And impossible targets lead to giving up.

Define what "good enough" looks like. Then aim for that. If you hit it early, you can always aim higher. But if you only aim for perfect, you'll never finish.

---

## Targets That Are Feelings

Sometimes the target isn't a thing—it's a feeling.

"I want to feel secure about money" is a valid target. But you still need to define what that means in practice.

What would make you feel secure? Six months of savings? Zero debt? A certain income level? A certain spending level?

Turn the feeling into something measurable. Then you have a target you can actually hit.

---

## When to Refine Targets

Targets aren't set in stone. They're starting points.

You'll learn things as you build. You'll discover what actually matters. You'll realize your original target was too vague, or too ambitious, or not ambitious enough.

That's normal. That's learning.

Refine your target when:
- You learn new information that changes what's possible
- You discover the target doesn't actually solve the problem
- You realize the target is too easy or too hard
- You find out what you really want is different

Don't refine it every week. But don't stick to a bad target just because you wrote it down.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 1—defining the target—is the foundation. If the target is bad, everything else is built on sand.

A good target makes Move 2 (parts) possible. A good target makes Move 3 (acquisition) clear. A good target makes Move 4 (loops) measurable.

But you'll loop back to Move 1 as you learn. That's normal. That's how building works.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Write your target.** Answer all five questions. Be specific. Use numbers.

2. **Define "good enough."** What's the minimum version that would still work?

3. **Test it:** Can you measure progress? Can you know when you're done? If not, make it more specific.

4. **Write it down where you'll see it.** Targets are useless if you forget them.

5. **Expect to refine it.** You'll learn things. You'll adjust. That's normal.

---

*Bad targets are wishes. Good targets are work. Write targets you can actually hit.*

# Chapter 7: Breaking Big Things Into Buildable Parts

Big things are impossible. Small things are doable.

The trick is breaking the big thing into small enough parts that you can actually build them. Not perfect parts. Not complete parts. Just parts small enough to start.

This chapter is about how to break things down without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.

---

## The Principle

If a part feels too big, it's not a part yet. It's still a whole thing.

Keep breaking it down until you can answer: "Can I do this in one session? Or at least start it in one session?"

If the answer is no, break it down more.

---

## How Small Is Small Enough?

A part is small enough when:
- You can start it without needing ten other things first
- You can finish it (or make visible progress) in one work session
- You can check it off a list and feel like you accomplished something
- You know what "done" looks like for that specific part

It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be buildable.

---

## Examples of Breaking Down

**Too big:** "Remodel the bathroom."

**Better:** "Demo existing fixtures and tile."

**Still too big?** "Remove the toilet." "Remove the vanity." "Remove the tile from one wall."

**Too big:** "Get in shape."

**Better:** "Establish sleep routine." "Establish hydration routine." "Establish movement baseline."

**Still too big?** "Go to bed at 10pm for one week." "Drink 32oz of water before noon." "Walk 5,000 steps today."

**Too big:** "Fix my finances."

**Better:** "Track expenses for one month." "List all debts with amounts and interest rates." "Calculate monthly surplus or deficit."

**Still too big?** "Download expense tracking app." "Log expenses for one day." "List credit card debts only."

---

## The Order Matters (Sometimes)

Some parts have to come before others. You can't install tile before you do drywall. You can't pay off debt before you know how much you have.

But don't let order become an excuse to not start.

If you're not sure about order, ask: "What's the first thing I can do that doesn't require anything else?"

Start there. You'll figure out the order as you go.

---

## When Parts Reveal New Parts

As you build, you'll discover parts you didn't know you needed.

You start tiling and realize you need to fix the wall first. You start tracking expenses and realize you need to categorize them. You start a new routine and realize you need to adjust your environment.

That's normal. That's learning.

Add the new parts to your list. Don't treat them as failures. Treat them as discoveries.

---

## The "First Buildable Piece" Rule

Always identify the first thing you can actually start right now.

Not the most important thing. Not the hardest thing. The first thing you can do with what you have, where you are, right now.

Start there. Build momentum. Then tackle the next part.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 2—identifying parts—turns Move 1's target into something buildable.

Once you have parts, you can figure out what's missing (Move 3). Once you know what's missing, you can acquire it. Once you have the parts, you can build loops (Move 4).

But if you skip Move 2, you're trying to build the whole thing at once. That's how people get overwhelmed.

---

## Action Steps

1. **List all the parts you can think of.** Don't worry about order. Don't worry about completeness. Just get them down.

2. **Break down anything that feels too big.** If you can't start it in one session, break it down more.

3. **Identify the first buildable piece.** What can you start right now with what you have?

4. **Expect to discover more parts.** As you build, you'll find things you didn't know you needed. Add them to the list.

5. **Don't try to build everything at once.** Pick one part. Build it. Then pick the next part.

---

*Big things are impossible. Small things are doable. Break it down until it's small enough to start.*

# Chapter 8: Acquiring What You Need (Without Over-Preparing)

Most people over-prepare and under-execute.

They research forever. They buy all the tools. They take all the courses. They read all the books. Then they're too exhausted to actually build.

**Move 3 isn't about getting everything perfect. It's about getting enough to start.**

This chapter is about acquiring what you need without getting stuck in preparation hell.

---

## The 80% Rule

You don't need 100% of what you need. You need 80%.

The last 20% you'll figure out as you go. You'll learn by doing. You'll acquire more as you discover gaps.

But if you wait for 100%, you'll never start.

---

## What Do You Actually Need?

Before you start acquiring, ask: "What's the minimum I need to start the first part?"

Not the whole project. Just the first part.

If the first part is "remove the toilet," you need:
- Basic tools (probably already have them)
- Knowledge of how to shut off water (5-minute YouTube video)
- Knowledge of how to remove a toilet (5-minute YouTube video)

That's it. You don't need to know how to install the new toilet yet. You'll learn that when you get to that part.

---

## Fast Acquisition Strategies

**For skills:** Find the fastest way to learn enough to start. YouTube. One book. One course. One conversation with someone who knows. Don't take five courses. Take one. Start. Learn more as you go.

**For tools:** Buy the cheapest version that works. Or borrow. Or rent. You don't need the best tools. You need tools that work. Upgrade later if you need to.

**For information:** Get 80% clarity, not 100%. Talk to one person who's done it. Read one article. Watch one video. Then start. You'll learn more as you build.

**For clarity:** Ask the questions that block you from starting. Not all the questions. Just the ones that prevent the first step.

**For support:** Find one person. Not a whole team. One person who can help, answer questions, or hold you accountable.

---

## When to Stop Acquiring

Stop acquiring when you have enough to start the first part.

Not when you have everything for the whole project. Not when you're an expert. When you have enough to start.

Then start. Acquire more as you need it.

---

## The Research Trap

Research feels productive. It feels like progress. But it's often procrastination in disguise.

Set a time limit. "I'll research for two hours, then I start." Or "I'll talk to three people, then I start." Or "I'll read one book, then I start."

Then actually start. Don't let research become an excuse to not build.

---

## Borrowing vs. Buying

You don't need to own everything.

Borrow tools. Rent equipment. Use free resources. Ask for help.

Buy only what you'll use repeatedly. For one-time use, borrow or rent.

---

## Learning as You Go

The best way to learn is by doing.

You'll learn more from installing one toilet than from watching ten videos. You'll learn more from tracking expenses for one month than from reading five finance books.

Acquire enough to start. Then learn by doing. Acquire more as you discover what you actually need.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 3—acquiring parts—makes Move 2's list actionable.

Once you have the parts (or a plan to get them), you can start building loops (Move 4). But if you skip Move 3, you're stuck with a list of things you don't have.

But don't let Move 3 become a trap. Get enough to start. Then start. Acquire more as you go.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Identify what's missing for the first part.** Not the whole project. Just the first part.

2. **Find the fastest way to get 80%.** Not 100%. What's the minimum you need to start?

3. **Set a time limit on research.** Two hours? One day? Then start.

4. **Borrow before buying.** For one-time use, borrow or rent. Buy only what you'll use repeatedly.

5. **Start with what you have.** Don't wait for perfect. Start. Learn. Acquire more as you go.

---

*Get enough to start. Then start. Don't let preparation become procrastination.*

# Chapter 9: Building Loops That Actually Move

Loops are how you make progress.

But not all loops are created equal. Some loops spin in place. Some loops move you backward. Some loops actually move you forward.

This chapter is about building loops that work.

---

## What Makes a Loop Work

A working loop has four parts:

**TRY:** Do something. Start small. Pick one part. Do it.

**CHECK:** What happened? Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Be honest.

**ADJUST:** What needs to change? What can you do differently? What did you learn?

**REPEAT:** Try again with the adjustment. Or try the next part. Keep moving.

If any part is missing, the loop breaks.

---

## Common Loop Problems

**Problem: No CHECK.** You try things but never check if they worked. You don't know what's happening. You're building blind.

**Fix:** Set check-in points. After one day? Three days? One week? Check. Be honest about what happened.

**Problem: No ADJUST.** You check, see it's not working, but do the same thing again. The loop spins but doesn't move.

**Fix:** When something doesn't work, change something. Not everything. One thing. What's the smallest change that might help?

**Problem: No REPEAT.** You try once, it doesn't work perfectly, you give up. One loop isn't a system.

**Fix:** Loops are meant to repeat. Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.

**Problem: TRY is too big.** You try to do everything at once. It's overwhelming. You can't check or adjust because you don't know what worked.

**Fix:** Make TRY small. One part. One behavior. One step. Small enough to check and adjust.

---

## Loop Frequency

How often should you loop?

**Daily loops:** For habits, routines, small behaviors. Check every day. Adjust quickly.

**Weekly loops:** For systems, processes, medium-sized projects. Check once a week. Adjust as needed.

**Monthly loops:** For bigger projects, long-term goals. Check once a month. Adjust strategy.

**Project loops:** For specific tasks. Check at natural break points. Adjust before continuing.

The frequency should match the thing. Don't check daily on a year-long project. Don't check monthly on a daily habit.

---

## The Adjustment Principle

When something doesn't work, change something.

Not everything. One thing. The smallest change that might help.

If you're not hitting your water goal, try:
- Smaller goal? (60oz instead of 80oz)
- Different timing? (Drink in morning instead of all day)
- Different method? (Bottle instead of glass)
- Different reminder? (Alarm instead of memory)

Change one thing. See if it helps. If not, change something else.

---

## When Loops Reveal New Information

As you loop, you'll learn things.

You'll discover the target needs refining. You'll find parts you didn't know you needed. You'll realize you need to acquire different things.

That's normal. That's how loops work.

Loop back to earlier moves. Refine the target. Add new parts. Acquire what's missing. Then continue the loop.

---

## Momentum Through Small Wins

Loops create momentum through small wins.

Every time you complete a loop—TRY, CHECK, ADJUST, REPEAT—you've made progress. Even if the thing didn't work perfectly, you learned something. You adjusted. You're moving.

That momentum is valuable. Don't break it by trying to do everything at once.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Move 4—building loops—is how you execute the other moves.

You'll loop back to Move 1 (refining targets) as you learn. You'll loop back to Move 2 (discovering new parts) as you build. You'll loop back to Move 3 (acquiring more) as you find gaps.

The Four Moves aren't linear. They're a cycle. Loops keep that cycle moving.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one small thing to try.** Not the whole project. One part. One behavior.

2. **Set a check-in point.** When will you check if it worked? Match the frequency to the thing.

3. **Be honest about what happened.** Did it work? What worked? What didn't? Don't sugarcoat it.

4. **Adjust one thing.** Not everything. One thing. The smallest change that might help.

5. **Repeat.** Try again. Or try the next thing. Keep the loop moving.

---

*Loops are how you make progress. Build loops that work. Keep them moving.*

# Chapter 10: When Things Go Wrong (And They Will)

Things will go wrong.

You'll open a wall and find rot. You'll start a project and realize you're missing critical information. You'll build a loop and discover it doesn't work. You'll acquire parts and find out they're the wrong parts.

That's not failure. That's building.

This chapter is about what to do when things go wrong.

---

## The First Rule: Don't Panic

When things go wrong, the first thing to do is nothing.

Don't panic. Don't give up. Don't start over. Just stop. Breathe. Assess.

Most problems aren't as bad as they seem. Most problems are solvable. But you can't solve them if you're panicking.

---

## The Second Rule: Use the System

When things go wrong, go back to the Four Moves.

**Move 1:** What's the actual problem? Define it clearly. Not what you think it is. What it actually is.

**Move 2:** What parts do you need to fix it? Break the problem into parts.

**Move 3:** What's missing? What do you need to acquire to fix it?

**Move 4:** What loop can you build to address it? Try, check, adjust, repeat.

The system works for problems too. Not just projects.

---

## Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem: You discover the target was wrong.**

**Solution:** Refine the target. Don't scrap everything. Adjust. You learned something. Use it.

**Problem: You find parts you didn't know you needed.**

**Solution:** Add them to the list. Don't treat it as failure. Treat it as discovery. Then acquire them (Move 3).

**Problem: Something you acquired doesn't work.**

**Solution:** Adjust. Try a different approach. Acquire something else. Don't give up. Pivot.

**Problem: Your loop isn't working.**

**Solution:** Check what's not working. Adjust one thing. Try again. Loops are meant to be adjusted.

**Problem: You're stuck and don't know why.**

**Solution:** Go back to Move 1. What are you actually trying to build? Is it clear? If not, define it. Then work through the moves again.

---

## When to Pivot vs. When to Persist

Not every problem means you should quit. Not every problem means you should persist.

**Pivot when:**
- The target doesn't actually solve the problem
- You discover what you really want is different
- The approach fundamentally won't work
- The cost (time, money, energy) exceeds the value

**Persist when:**
- You just need to adjust the approach
- You need to acquire different parts
- You need to refine the target
- You're just hitting normal friction

The difference? Pivoting means changing what you're building. Persisting means changing how you're building it.

---

## The "Sit Down" Moment

INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: Opening a wall and finding something so stupid you have to sit down, then figuring out how to handle it.

Sometimes problems are so big you have to sit down. Literally or figuratively.

That's okay. Take a break. Assess. Then use the system.

Most problems are solvable. Even the ones that make you sit down.

---

## Learning from Problems

Problems are information.

They tell you what you didn't know. They reveal gaps in your plan. They show you what actually matters.

Don't waste that information. Use it. Adjust. Improve.

Every problem you solve makes you better at solving the next one.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

The Four Moves work for problems too.

When something goes wrong, define the problem (Move 1). Break it into parts (Move 2). Acquire what you need to fix it (Move 3). Build loops to address it (Move 4).

The system doesn't break when things go wrong. It shows you how to handle it.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Don't panic.** Stop. Breathe. Assess. Most problems aren't as bad as they seem.

2. **Define the actual problem.** What went wrong? Be specific. Not what you think it is. What it actually is.

3. **Use the system.** Apply the Four Moves to the problem. Break it down. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

4. **Decide: Pivot or persist?** Is the approach wrong, or just the execution? Adjust accordingly.

5. **Learn from it.** What did the problem teach you? Use that information. Don't waste it.

---

*Things will go wrong. That's building. Use the system. Fix it. Keep moving.*

# Chapter 11: The Remodel Metaphor (When It Helps)

This book uses remodel and construction metaphors because that's my world.

But metaphors are tools. They help when they clarify. They hurt when they confuse.

This chapter is about when to use the metaphor and when to drop it.

---

## When the Metaphor Helps

The metaphor helps when it:
- Makes an abstract idea concrete
- Shows how something works in a familiar context
- Provides a clear parallel that illuminates the real thing
- Creates a shared language for talking about complex ideas

Example: "Breaking a big task into parts is like taking apart a bathroom: plumbing, electrical, tile, paint." That works. It's clear. It helps.

---

## When to Drop the Metaphor

The metaphor hurts when it:
- Adds confusion instead of clarity
- Forces connections that don't actually fit
- Distracts from the real point
- Makes things more complicated instead of simpler

Example: "This relationship is like a deck board with termites chewing the screws of destiny." That's too much. It doesn't help. Drop it.

---

## The Core Metaphors That Work

**House = the self.** Your identity, your life, your systems. The structure you're building or fixing.

**Remodel = life change.** Any big project. Health, money, work, relationships, identity. You're updating something.

**Demo = removing old habits or roles.** Taking out what doesn't work. Making space for new things.

**Parts = components of the project.** The things you need to build. Skills, tools, information, systems.

**Loops = execution cycles.** TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT. How you actually build.

**Punchlist = finishing work.** The small things that make it complete. The details that matter.

**Missing studs = lack of support or structure.** Gaps in your foundation. Things that need reinforcement.

These metaphors work because they're simple, clear, and actually parallel the real thing.

---

## When Plain Language Is Better

Sometimes the best metaphor is no metaphor.

When you're explaining something deeply personal or emotionally heavy, plain language is better. When the metaphor would distract from the point, drop it. When a simple story works better, use that.

The goal is clarity, not consistency with the metaphor.

---

## Using Metaphors Strategically

Don't force the metaphor into every paragraph. Use it when it helps. Drop it when it doesn't.

Think of it like seasoning. A little bit enhances the dish. Too much ruins it.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

The Four Moves work with or without the metaphor.

You can explain them using construction language. You can explain them using plain language. You can explain them using examples from any domain.

The system is universal. The metaphor is just one way to talk about it.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Use the metaphor when it clarifies.** If it makes something clearer, use it.

2. **Drop it when it confuses.** If it adds complexity instead of clarity, drop it.

3. **Don't force it.** The metaphor is a tool, not a requirement. Use it strategically.

4. **Plain language is always valid.** Sometimes the best explanation is the simplest one.

5. **The system works either way.** The Four Moves don't depend on the metaphor. They work regardless.

---

*Metaphors are tools. Use them when they help. Drop them when they don't. Clarity is the goal.*

# Chapter 12: Applying the System to Money

Money is just another remodel.

You're fixing something. You're building something. You're updating systems. The Four Moves work here too.

This chapter shows you how.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Money To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be financially secure."

**Defined:** "I want six months of expenses saved ($18,000), zero credit card debt ($8,000), and a system that maintains this within 18 months. I want to feel secure, not anxious, about money."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Understand current income (exact number, after taxes)
- Understand current expenses (where does money actually go?)
- List all debts (amounts, interest rates, minimum payments)
- Calculate monthly surplus or deficit
- Create emergency fund plan
- Create debt payoff plan
- Set up automation systems
- Build tracking system
- Review and adjust monthly

Each part is buildable. Each part can be checked off.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know exact expenses. Don't have tracking system. Don't know debt payoff strategies.

**Acquisition:**
- Track expenses for one month (free app or spreadsheet)
- Read one book on debt payoff (library, free)
- Talk to one person who fixed their finances (friend, free)
- Set up simple spreadsheet or free budgeting app
- Use online calculator for numbers (free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you go.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Monthly tracking loop:**
- Track all expenses (TRY)
- Review at month end (CHECK: Where did money go? Did I hit targets?)
- Adjust budget or habits (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat next month (REPEAT)

**Debt payoff loop:**
- Pay minimums plus extra to one debt (TRY)
- Check progress after three months (CHECK: How much paid off? On track?)
- Adjust strategy if needed (ADJUST: Different debt? Different amount?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Savings loop:**
- Automate savings transfer each month (TRY)
- Check balance quarterly (CHECK: How much saved? On track?)
- Adjust amount if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different account?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

---

## Common Money Problems

**Problem: "I don't know where my money goes."**

**Solution:** Track for one month. That's Move 2 (identify the part) and Move 4 (build a tracking loop). Don't try to be perfect. Just track. You'll learn.

**Problem: "I have too much debt."**

**Solution:** List all debts (Move 2). Choose a payoff strategy (Move 3: acquire knowledge). Build a payoff loop (Move 4). Start with one debt. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I can't save money."**

**Solution:** Define what "saving" means (Move 1: specific target). Automate it (Move 3: acquire system). Build a savings loop (Move 4). Start small. Build the habit.

**Problem: "I'm anxious about money."**

**Solution:** Define what would make you feel secure (Move 1: target based on feeling). Build systems that create that security (Moves 2, 3, 4). Security comes from systems, not amounts.

---

## The Key Insight

Money management isn't about willpower. It's about systems.

Build systems (loops) that work. Automate what you can. Track what you need to. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build those systems.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Money is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your money target.** Be specific. Use numbers. What does "done" look like?

2. **List the parts.** What do you need to build? Income clarity? Expense clarity? Debt plan? Savings plan? Systems?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Tools? Systems? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Tracking loops. Payoff loops. Savings loops. Keep them moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover new parts. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

---

*Money is just another remodel. Use the Four Moves. Build systems. Keep the loops moving.*

# Chapter 13: Applying the System to Work and Career

Your career is a project. You're building something. You're fixing something. You're updating your role, your skills, your trajectory.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Career To Be?

**Vague:** "I want a better job."

**Defined:** "I want to transition from my current role to a project management position in the next 18 months. I need to learn three specific skills, build a portfolio of three completed projects, and network with five people in that field."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Research what project management actually requires
- Identify three specific skills to learn
- Find learning resources (courses, books, mentors)
- Build first project portfolio piece
- Build second project portfolio piece
- Build third project portfolio piece
- Network with five people in the field
- Update resume with new skills
- Practice interview skills
- Apply to positions
- Negotiate offers

Each part is buildable. Each part moves you forward.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know what project management requires. Don't have portfolio. Don't know anyone in the field.

**Acquisition:**
- Talk to three project managers (LinkedIn, coffee chats)
- Read one book on project management basics
- Take one free online course
- Build first portfolio piece using current job projects (reframe existing work)
- Join one project management group (online or local)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you network and build.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Skill-building loop:**
- Learn one skill (TRY)
- Apply it to a project (CHECK: Did it work? What did I learn?)
- Adjust approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Learn next skill (REPEAT)

**Networking loop:**
- Reach out to one person per month (TRY)
- Have conversation, ask questions (CHECK: What did I learn? What connections made?)
- Adjust approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Reach out to next person (REPEAT)

**Portfolio loop:**
- Complete one project (TRY)
- Document it, add to portfolio (CHECK: Does it show the skills I need?)
- Adjust next project based on gaps (ADJUST)
- Build next project (REPEAT)

**Application loop:**
- Apply to positions (TRY)
- Track responses, interviews (CHECK: What's working? What's not?)
- Adjust resume, approach, targets (ADJUST)
- Apply again (REPEAT)

---

## Common Career Problems

**Problem: "I don't know what I want to do."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What problem are you trying to solve? What feeling are you aiming for? Define "better" specifically. Then work through the moves.

**Problem: "I don't have the skills."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. Identify the skills you need (Move 2). Acquire them (Move 3). Build skill-building loops (Move 4). Start with one skill. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I don't know anyone in that field."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. Network with one person (Move 4: build networking loop). They'll introduce you to others. Start small. Build connections.

**Problem: "I'm stuck in my current role."**

**Solution:** Apply the Four Moves to your current role first. What do you want it to be? What parts need to change? What do you need to acquire? What loops can you build? Sometimes fixing where you are is the path to where you want to go.

---

## The Key Insight

Career change isn't about one big leap. It's about building the parts: skills, portfolio, network, clarity.

Build them one at a time. Use loops to make progress. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build a career systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Work and career are just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your career target.** Be specific. What role? What skills? What timeline? What does "done" look like?

2. **List the parts.** Skills? Portfolio? Network? Resume? Interview skills? What do you need to build?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Skills? Connections? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Skill-building loops. Networking loops. Portfolio loops. Application loops. Keep them moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover new parts. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

---

*Your career is a project. Use the Four Moves. Build the parts. Keep the loops moving.*

# Chapter 14: Applying the System to Health

Health is a remodel. You're fixing systems. You're building habits. You're updating your body, your energy, your capacity.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Health To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be healthy."

**Defined:** "I want to sleep 7-8 hours per night, have energy throughout the day without crashing, and move my body in ways that feel good five days per week. I want to feel strong and capable, not exhausted."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when you're done (or when you're maintaining it).

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Assess current sleep quality
- Assess current hydration
- Assess current food quality
- Assess current movement level
- Set sleep target and routine
- Set hydration target and system
- Improve food quality (one meal at a time)
- Add movement baseline (walking, whatever works)
- Build consistency loops (3-day, 7-day, 30-day checks)
- Adjust environment to support habits
- Get baseline health checkup

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know current sleep quality. Don't have movement routine. Don't know what "healthy enough" means for my body.

**Acquisition:**
- Track sleep for one week (free app)
- Talk to doctor about baseline health (one visit)
- Research one simple movement routine (walking, free online)
- Define "healthy enough" based on doctor input and personal goals

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you build habits.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Sleep loop:**
- Try new sleep routine (TRY: Go to bed at 10pm)
- Check after one week (CHECK: How do I feel? Am I hitting the target?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Earlier? Later? Different routine?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Hydration loop:**
- Try drinking 64oz water daily (TRY)
- Check after three days (CHECK: Did I hit it? How do I feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different timing?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Movement loop:**
- Try walking 5,000 steps daily (TRY)
- Check after one week (CHECK: Did I hit it? How do I feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: More? Less? Different activity?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Food loop:**
- Try improving one meal (TRY: Better breakfast)
- Check after one week (CHECK: How do I feel? Energy? Satisfaction?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different meal? Different approach?)
- Repeat, then move to next meal (REPEAT)

---

## Common Health Problems

**Problem: "I don't have energy."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What would give you energy? Sleep? Food? Movement? Define it. Then work through the moves. Often it's sleep. Start there.

**Problem: "I can't stick to routines."**

**Solution:** That's Move 4. Your loops are too big or too rigid. Make them smaller. Make them more flexible. Start with one tiny loop. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I don't know where to start."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 2. Pick the easiest part. Sleep is usually easiest. Or hydration. Or a 10-minute walk. Start small. Build momentum.

**Problem: "I've tried everything and nothing works."**

**Solution:** Go back to Move 1. What are you actually trying to build? Is the target clear? Is it realistic? Then check Move 4. Are your loops too big? Are you adjusting? Are you repeating?

---

## The Key Insight

Health isn't about perfect habits. It's about systems that work for your life.

Build small loops. Adjust as you learn. Don't try to fix everything at once.

The Four Moves give you a way to build health systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Health is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your health target.** Be specific. What does "healthy enough" mean for your life? What feeling are you aiming for?

2. **List the parts.** Sleep? Hydration? Food? Movement? What systems need building?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Baseline assessment? Tools? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Start with one. Sleep loop. Or hydration loop. Or movement loop. Keep it small. Keep it moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what works for your body. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

---

*Health is a remodel. Use the Four Moves. Build small loops. Keep them moving.*

# Chapter 15: Applying the System to Relationships

Relationships are remodels. You're fixing communication. You're building connection. You're updating patterns, boundaries, understanding.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want This Relationship To Be?

**Vague:** "I want us to communicate better."

**Defined:** "I want my partner and I to have one meaningful conversation per week where we both feel heard. We'll schedule it every Sunday at 7pm. We'll use a structure: each person gets five minutes to share, then we discuss."

That's a target. You can measure it. You can know when it's working.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Understand their needs (what do they actually need?)
- State your own needs (what do you actually need?)
- Build emotional regulation skills (so conversations don't escalate)
- Schedule regular conversations (time, structure)
- Learn to ask clarity questions (what do you mean? what do you need?)
- Build check-in loops (weekly, monthly)
- Adjust boundaries if needed
- Adjust communication patterns if needed

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know how to have structured conversations. Don't know what they actually need. Don't have emotional regulation skills.

**Acquisition:**
- Read one book on communication (library, free)
- Talk to one person who has good communication in their relationship (friend, free)
- Practice emotional regulation (breathing, pausing, free)
- Set up first scheduled conversation (free, just time)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you practice.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Weekly conversation loop:**
- Have scheduled conversation (TRY)
- Check how it went (CHECK: Did both people feel heard? What worked? What didn't?)
- Adjust structure or timing if needed (ADJUST)
- Repeat next week (REPEAT)

**Needs-check loop:**
- Ask what they need (TRY)
- Listen and clarify (CHECK: Do I understand? Do they feel heard?)
- Adjust your approach if needed (ADJUST)
- Check in again periodically (REPEAT)

**Boundary loop:**
- Try new boundary (TRY: "I need alone time on Saturdays")
- Check how it works (CHECK: Does it help? Does it cause problems?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different day? Different amount of time?)
- Maintain or refine (REPEAT)

---

## Common Relationship Problems

**Problem: "We don't communicate."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What would communication look like? Be specific. Then Move 4: build a communication loop. Start small. One conversation. Build from there.

**Problem: "We're always fighting."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need emotional regulation skills. And Move 4: you need loops that prevent escalation. Pause. Breathe. Schedule conversations when you're both calm.

**Problem: "I don't know what they need."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need to ask. And Move 4: build a needs-check loop. Ask. Listen. Clarify. Check in again.

**Problem: "We're growing apart."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What do you want this relationship to be? Then work through the moves. Sometimes relationships need remodels. Sometimes they need to end. The system helps you figure out which.

---

## The Key Insight

Relationships aren't about perfect communication. They're about systems that create connection.

Build small loops. Practice. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build relationships systematically.

---

4. **Build loops.** Start with one. Weekly conversation loop. Or needs-check loop. Keep it small. Keep it moving.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what works for your relationship. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

*Relationships are remodels. Use the Four Moves. Build loops. Keep them moving.*

# Chapter 16: Applying the System to Identity

Identity is a remodel. You're updating who you are. You're building new roles. You're fixing old patterns.

The Four Moves work here too.

---

## Move 1: What Do You Want Your Identity To Be?

**Vague:** "I want to be a better person."

**Defined:** "I want to be someone who shows up consistently, keeps commitments, and treats people with respect. I want to act like that person daily, even when it's hard."

That's a target. You can measure it through actions. You can know when you're living it.

---

## Move 2: What Parts Do You Need?

**Parts:**
- Identify current behaviors that don't match who you want to be
- Identify behaviors that do match who you want to be
- Build habits that reinforce the identity
- Adjust environment to support the identity
- Find people who reflect the identity you want
- Practice the behaviors daily
- Build identity loops (act → observe → adjust → repeat)

Each part is buildable. You don't do them all at once. You start with one behavior.

---

## Move 3: How Do We Get Those Parts?

**Missing:** Don't know what behaviors match the identity. Don't have habits that reinforce it. Don't have environment that supports it.

**Acquisition:**
- Read one book on identity and habits (library, free)
- Talk to one person who embodies the identity you want (free)
- Identify one small behavior to start (free, just awareness)
- Adjust one thing in your environment (might cost money, might be free)

That's enough to start. You'll learn more as you practice.

---

## Move 4: What Loops Do We Repeat?

**Identity loop:**
- Act like the person you want to be (TRY: one behavior, one day)
- Observe what happened (CHECK: Did it feel authentic? What worked? What didn't?)
- Adjust behaviors (ADJUST: What needs to change?)
- Repeat daily (REPEAT)

**Habit loop:**
- Do one behavior that reinforces identity (TRY: show up on time)
- Check if you did it (CHECK: Did I do it? How did it feel?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different behavior? Different trigger?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

**Environment loop:**
- Change one thing in your environment (TRY: remove trigger for bad habit)
- Check if it helps (CHECK: Does it make the good behavior easier?)
- Adjust if needed (ADJUST: Different change? More changes?)
- Repeat (REPEAT)

---

## Common Identity Problems

**Problem: "I don't know who I want to be."**

**Solution:** Start with Move 1. What problem are you trying to solve? What feeling are you aiming for? Define it through behaviors, not abstract concepts.

**Problem: "I keep acting like my old self."**

**Solution:** That's Move 4. Your loops aren't working. Make them smaller. Start with one behavior. One day. Build momentum. Identity is built through repeated actions.

**Problem: "My environment doesn't support who I want to be."**

**Solution:** That's Move 3. You need to adjust your environment. And Move 4: build environment loops. Change one thing. See if it helps. Adjust. Repeat.

**Problem: "I feel like a fraud when I try to be different."**

**Solution:** That's normal. Identity change feels awkward at first. That's Move 4: keep the loop moving. Act. Observe. Adjust. Repeat. It gets more natural with practice.

---

## The Key Insight

Identity isn't about who you think you are. It's about who you act like.

Act like the person you want to be. Do it daily. Build loops. Adjust as you learn.

The Four Moves give you a way to build identity systematically.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

Identity is just another domain. The Four Moves work here like they work everywhere.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

Same system. Different context.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Define your identity target.** Be specific. What behaviors? What actions? What does this person do daily?

2. **List the parts.** Habits? Environment? People? What systems need building?

3. **Acquire what's missing.** Knowledge? Skills? Support? Get enough to start.

4. **Build loops.** Start with one behavior. Act like that person. Observe. Adjust. Repeat daily.

5. **Adjust as you learn.** You'll discover what feels authentic. You'll refine the target. That's normal. Keep the loops moving.

---

*Identity is a remodel. Act like who you want to be. Build loops. Keep them moving.*

# Chapter 17: The System Is Universal

The Four Moves work for everything.

Money. Work. Health. Relationships. Identity. Remodels. Projects. Life.

Not because the system is magic. Because the system is how building works.

This chapter is about seeing the pattern everywhere.

---

## The Pattern

**Move 1:** Define what you want it to be. Make the problem solvable.

**Move 2:** Break it into parts. Make it buildable.

**Move 3:** Acquire what's missing. Get enough to start.

**Move 4:** Build loops. TRY → CHECK → ADJUST → REPEAT.

That's it. That's the pattern. It works for everything because it's how building works.

---

## Why It Works

The system works because it:
- Forces you to define the problem before solving it
- Breaks impossible tasks into possible parts
- Focuses on getting enough to start, not everything perfect
- Builds in learning and adjustment through loops
- Creates momentum through small wins

It's not complicated. It's just systematic.

---

## The Moves Loop Back

The Four Moves aren't linear. They loop back on each other.

You'll refine the target (Move 1) as you learn. You'll discover new parts (Move 2) as you build. You'll need to acquire more (Move 3) as you find gaps. Move 4 keeps it all moving.

That's normal. That's how building works.

---

## When Things Go Wrong

When things go wrong, use the system.

Define the problem (Move 1). Break it into parts (Move 2). Acquire what you need to fix it (Move 3). Build loops to address it (Move 4).

The system works for problems too. Not just projects.

---

## The Metaphor Is Optional

The remodel metaphor helps when it clarifies. It hurts when it confuses.

Use it when it helps. Drop it when it doesn't.

The system works either way.

---

## Start Small

Don't try to fix everything at once.

Pick one thing. Apply the Four Moves. Build loops. Keep them moving.

Then pick the next thing.

---

## Keep the Loops Moving

Progress is circular, not linear.

Build loops. Keep them moving. That's how you finish.

---

## Connection to the Four Moves

This whole book is the Four Moves applied to the Four Moves.

We defined what the system should be (Move 1). We broke it into parts (Move 2: four moves, examples, applications). We acquired what we needed to explain it (Move 3: stories, metaphors, clarity). We built loops to teach it (Move 4: chapters, examples, repetition).

The system explains itself.

---

## Action Steps

1. **Pick one thing.** Don't try to fix everything. Pick one project, one problem, one area.

2. **Apply all four moves.** Don't skip steps. Define the target. List the parts. Acquire what's missing. Build loops.

3. **Start the loops.** Don't wait for perfect. Start with what you have. Adjust as you go.

4. **Expect to loop back.** You'll refine the target. You'll discover new parts. You'll need to acquire more. That's normal.

5. **Keep the loops moving.** Progress is circular. Keep it spinning.

---

*The system is universal. Use it. Keep the loops moving. That's how you finish.*

# Outro

That's the system. Four moves. That's it.

You can use it for anything. Money. Work. Health. Relationships. Identity. Remodels. Projects. Life.

Not because it's magic. Because it's how building works.

---

## What You Have Now

You have a system that:
- Turns impossible tasks into buildable parts
- Gives you a way to start without having everything
- Builds in learning and adjustment
- Creates momentum through loops
- Works for anything

You don't need to be perfect. You need to keep the loops moving.

---

## What to Do Next

Pick one thing. One project. One problem. One area of your life.

Apply the Four Moves:
1. What do you want it to be?
2. What parts do you need?
3. How do we get those parts?
4. What loops do we repeat?

Start. Build loops. Keep them moving.

Then pick the next thing.

---

## Remember

Big tasks aren't hard. Undefined tasks are impossible.

Progress is circular, not linear.

You don't need everything. You need enough to start.

Things will go wrong. Use the system. Fix it. Keep moving.

The system works when you use it.

---

## Final Thought

"Looks good from my house" means knowing when to stop perfecting and start shipping.

But first, you gotta know what you're building.

Define the target. Break it into parts. Acquire what you need. Build loops.

That's how you finish.

---

*Let's build something.*
