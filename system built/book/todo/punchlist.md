\# PUNCHLIST — NEXT STEPS FOR “LOOKS GOOD FROM MY HOUSE”

Master list of fixes, upgrades, and refinements for the manuscript and the writing system.



---



\## 1. STORY INSERTION (HIGH PRIORITY)

Cursor used placeholders such as:

“INSERT REAL STORY ABOUT: \[topic]”



Tasks:

\- Review each placeholder in draft.md

\- Replace with real personal stories from remodels, work, ADHD-inattentive moments, finance stuff, family stuff, etc.

\- Validate that each story supports the chapter’s core principle

\- Remove or tighten any story that drags pacing



---



\## 2. VOICE CONSISTENCY PASS

Apply updated voice rules:



\### Add to voice guide:

\- Keep humor as seasoning, not the main dish

\- Add “direct + disarmingly honest” tone (your natural voice)

\- Avoid guru-bro language entirely

\- Favor short, punchy sentences

\- Use tradesman analogies sparingly but impactfully

\- Let “blue-collar philosopher” energy run the show

\- Always prefer clarity over cleverness



Tasks:

\- Update `/book/core/voice-guide.md` to match

\- Pass through each chapter to ensure alignment



---



\## 3. METAPHOR SANITY CHECK

Cursor did a good job, but we need a human eye:



Tasks:

\- Check every metaphor for:

&nbsp; - clarity

&nbsp; - non-forced usage

&nbsp; - alignment with the remodel theme

\- Remove metaphors that feel stretched

\- Ensure the metaphor isn’t repeated too frequently within a chapter



---



\## 4. CHAPTER STRUCTURE VERIFICATION

All chapters should follow the 7-part architecture from the control doc.



Tasks:

\- Confirm each chapter has:

&nbsp; - Hook

&nbsp; - Concept

&nbsp; - Remodel example

&nbsp; - Life/career/health/etc example

&nbsp; - “Why it matters”

&nbsp; - Connection to Four Moves

&nbsp; - Action Steps



Flag chapters missing or weak in any section.



---



\## 5. TITLE \& SUBTITLE SELECTION

Tasks:

\- Create 10 possible titles

\- Create 10 possible subtitles

\- Pick 3 finalists

\- Validate against:

&nbsp; - book positioning

&nbsp; - tone

&nbsp; - readability

&nbsp; - Amazon friendliness



---



\## 6. INTRO \& OUTRO TIGHTENING

Tasks:

\- Strengthen opening hook

\- Ensure callback punchline in outro fully pays off the intro

\- Add a one-sentence promise statement early in the intro

\- Add a final “this is for you if…” section at the end of intro



---



\## 7. FOUR-MOVE SYSTEM CLARITY PASS

Tasks:

\- Refine definitions of each Move in `/book/core/system-four-moves.md`

\- Make each chapter explicitly tie back to one or more Moves

\- Ensure Move 4 (loops) is consistent and explained tightly



---



\## 8. ACTION STEP REFINEMENT

Tasks:

\- Ensure every chapter ends with 3–5 useful steps

\- Steps must be:

&nbsp; - actionable

&nbsp; - finishable in a day or less

&nbsp; - written in plain, punchy language

\- Remove redundant steps across chapters



---



\## 9. READABILITY \& FLOW CHECK

Tasks:

\- Smooth transitions between chapters

\- Remove accidental repetitions

\- Fix any rambling segments Cursor produced

\- Ensure logical flow from Part I → Part II → Part III



---



\## 10. BUILD THE STORY BANK

Create `/book/core/story-bank.md` with sections:

\- Remodel stories

\- Work/career stories

\- ADHD-inattentive stories

\- Finance stories

\- Relationship stories

\- Identity stories

\- Parenting/family stories



Tasks:

\- Fill each category with 3–5 story summaries

\- Then assign each story to its chapter(s)



---



\## 11. CURSOR AUTOMATION PROMPT (FINAL STEP)

Write the meta-prompt for Cursor to:



\- read control-document.md  

\- read updated voice-guide.md  

\- read updated metaphor-guide.md  

\- read punchlist.md  



and then:



\- fix each chapter  

\- log changes in changelog.md  

\- merge revised chapters into draft.md  



(This comes after story insertion.)



---



\## 12. FINAL POLISH \& MANUSCRIPT MERGE

After manual edits:

\- run full Grammarly/ProWritingAid pass  

\- format for Kindle + print  

\- export clean `manuscript\_final.md`
