## Canonical Sequence of Events

### Phase 1: Discovery (Day 1)

1. **Artifact Discovery:**
   - Vex Three-Stance discovered Amber fragment during routine sweep
   - Fragment embedded in asteroid chunk
   - Asteroid chunk pulled into station's docking bay during routine operations
   - Fragment size: no larger than a fist

2. **Initial Effects:**
   - Immediate system glitches upon artifact arrival
   - Lights flickering
   - Station's gravity generators fluctuating
   - Systems glitched throughout station

3. **Biological System Interaction (Mara's Observation):**
   - Mara Deep-Current noticed unique detail others missed
   - Fragment's energy interacting with station's biological systems
   - Air recyclers affected
   - Food processors affected
   - Life support systems affected

### Phase 2: Containment Protocols (Day 1)

4. **Warden Response:**
   - Vex identified artifact immediately by energy signature
   - Recommended immediate containment
   - Warden team set up quarantine field
   - Called for backup
   - Began evacuation procedures

5. **Mara's Warning:**
   - Tried to warn others that Amber was interacting with biological systems
   - Explained containment protocols might not work as expected
   - Biological system reactions didn't follow normal physics

### Phase 3: Confrontation (Day 1)

6. **Combine Intervention:**
   - Combine research team forced way into docking bay
   - Bypassed security systems
   - Ignored protocols
   - Claimed authorization and mandate to secure dangerous materials

7. **Warden Defense:**
   - Kaelen and Tessa formed defensive line, blocking Combine access
   - Mara positioned herself to disable Combine equipment
   - Vex tried to secure artifact before either side could reach it
   - Attempted to get artifact into proper containment

8. **The Touch:**
   - One Combine researcher (young scientist) touched artifact directly
   - Believed he was doing important work
   - Before Vex could secure artifact, before containment could complete

### Phase 4: Channeling Event (Day 1)

9. **Reality Warping:**
   - The world bent
   - Space folded
   - Light curved in ways that shouldn't be possible
   - Station's artificial gravity inverted, then normalized, then inverted repeatedly
   - Machines shorted out in cascading failures
   - Screens went black
   - Air tasted like ozone and something unnamed

10. **Biological System Response (Mara's Perspective):**
    - Station's life support reacted to Amber's energy
    - Air recyclers started processing something that wasn't air
    - Food processors began breaking down matter in ways that shouldn't be possible
    - Biological systems reacting in ways containment couldn't control

11. **Combine Researchers Frozen:**
    - Not figuratively—literally
    - Stopped moving, stopped speaking, stopped breathing
    - Stood perfectly still, eyes wide, expressions fixed
    - Paused mid-action
    - Caught in whatever field the artifact generated
    - Trapped in stasis

12. **Warden Team Response:**
    - Wardens protected by training and Amber-resistant gear, remained functional
    - Vex's previous Amber exposure (10 years ago) gave survival knowledge, understood what was happening
    - Vex felt Amber's energy recognizing something in her physiology
    - Mara screamed, tried to explain biological systems were reacting dangerously
    - Kaelen maintained defensive position, witnessed reality-bending firsthand

### Phase 5: Containment (Day 1)

13. **Containment Decision:**
    - Tessa made the call (team leader)
    - Activated station's emergency containment protocols
    - Sealed entire docking bay section
    - Artifact, frozen researchers, and reacting biological systems all locked away

14. **Containment Field:**
    - Containment field engaged
    - Section sealed
    - Artifact's energy field stabilized
    - Section locked until Amber-handling specialists could arrive

15. **Energy Field Expansion:**
    - Artifact's energy field had expanded
    - Touched station's outer hull
    - Metal stopped being entirely real (didn't breach, but stopped being solid)
    - Energy contained before expanding to entire station

### Phase 6: Aftermath (Days 2-7)

16. **Specialist Arrival:**
    - Amber-handling specialists arrived later
    - Confirmed researchers existed in impossible state between life and death
    - Not dead, not alive
    - Preserved in moment of contact with something that shouldn't exist
    - Station's biological systems permanently altered

17. **Permanent Alterations:**
    - Life support would never function the same way
    - Air recyclers would always process something slightly different than air
    - Food processors would always break down matter in ways that weren't entirely normal
    - Station's biological systems permanently changed

18. **Debriefings:**
    - Days of debriefings
    - Reports filed
    - Psychological evaluations
    - Wardens officially classified as Amber Channeling event

19. **Combine Response:**
    - Combine filed protests
    - Claimed Wardens mishandled situation
    - Demanded access to artifact
    - Wardens refused

## Character Perspectives and Interpretations

### Kaelen Voss (Human Vanguard):
- **Role:** Formed defensive line with Tessa, blocked Combine access
- **Perspective:** Saw event as proof Wardens' mission was necessary
- **Interpretation:** Containment was tragic but necessary to prevent expansion to entire station
- **Consequence:** Stayed with Wardens, commitment solidified despite recognizing methods are flawed
- **Path After:** Continued Warden service, assigned to The Spindle 5 years later

### Mara Deep-Current (Ærathi Pioneer):
- **Role:** Positioned to disable Combine equipment, provided biological system perspective
- **Perspective:** Noticed unique biological system interactions others missed
- **Interpretation:** Containment treated Amber as problem to solve rather than force to understand
- **Consequence:** Left Wardens one month after event
- **Path After:** Became independent operator, focused on understanding systems rather than controlling them

### Vex Three-Stance (Vazari Reclaimer):
- **Role:** Discovered artifact, tried to secure it, provided Reclaimer expertise
- **Perspective:** Previous exposure gave survival knowledge, understood what was happening
- **Interpretation:** Containment protocols weren't always sufficient, Amber's power beyond normal physics
- **Consequence:** Continued Reclaimer work with increased caution and respect
- **Path After:** Operating from The Spindle as independent contractor

### Kresh Four-Arm (Ash-Khadd Warden):
- **Role:** Stationed at Gamma-7 but on different rotation, witnessed aftermath only
- **Perspective:** Saw effectiveness of protocols but also how they sealed away researchers
- **Interpretation:** Understood both perspectives - containment worked but was imperfect
- **Consequence:** Stayed with Wardens, believes mission important despite imperfect methods
- **Path After:** Continued Warden service, assigned to The Spindle 2 years after Gamma-7
