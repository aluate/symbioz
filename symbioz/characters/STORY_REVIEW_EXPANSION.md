# Story Review Expansion - Additional Criteria

**Based on:** Frat's Devil's Advocate Review  
**Purpose:** Additional review requirements to ensure long-term viability, design clarity, and universe coherence  
**Status:** To be applied to all character stories

---

## Review Expansion Criteria

### 1. **Lore → Engine Alignment Must Be Bidirectional**

**Requirement:** Stories should not only be evaluated against existing lore, but patterns that emerge from stories should feed back into core gameplay systems.

**Action Items:**
- Identify recurring patterns (political factions, superstitions, economic scarcities, technologies)
- Propose engine integrations (faction reputation, black markets, diplomacy missions, resource-scarcity modifiers)
- Treat stories as lore stress-tests that can propose lore revisions
- Flag patterns that appear 2+ times for official lore incorporation

**Example:** If multiple characters reference Honey smuggling networks → propose black market mechanics, smuggling missions, border patrol systems

---

### 2. **Timeline Consistency Needs a Bounding Framework**

**Requirement:** Define 3-7 "epochal events" that all stories must anchor to for shared world gravity.

**Action Items:**
- Identify major historical events referenced across stories
- Ensure each story connects to at least one epochal event through:
  - Personal trauma
  - Political motivation
  - Military deployment
  - Regional hardship
  - Scientific discovery
  - Rumor or hearsay

**Example Events to Extract:**
- First Honey Extraction Treaty
- Collapse of major settlements
- First recorded Amber Channeling incident
- Major faction wars or treaties
- Scientific breakthroughs or disasters

---

### 3. **Systemic Themes Need Meta-Analysis**

**Requirement:** After all 10 stories are complete, produce meta-analysis extracting:
- Common motifs
- Friction points
- Ecosystem roles for species/classes
- Emergent ideological conflicts
- Mechanical systems suggested by narrative

**Deliverable:** `STORY_UNIVERSE_INSIGHTS.md` with:
- Recurring themes
- Conflicts that need representation
- Technologies that should be systematized
- Social problems requiring gameplay mechanics
- Proposed system integrations

---

### 4. **Power Disparity Review**

**Requirement:** Check for unintended racial/class power hierarchies revealed by narrative patterns.

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are any classes too often pivotal?
- Are any classes narratively under-leveraged?
- Do any races consistently come out morally neutral or too powerful?
- Does any class become the "default protagonist archetype"?
- Are there unintentional power fantasies?

**Action Items:**
- Balance pass on class/race representation
- Feedback on power budgets
- Recommendations for stat spread adjustments
- Honey affinity balancing
- Amber channeling limit verification

---

### 5. **Game Loop Anchoring**

**Requirement:** For each character, identify mission types the engine must support based on their lived experience.

**Per Character, Extract:**
- 3 mission archetypes clearly inspired by their past
- 3 world events the engine must be able to represent
- 2 NPC character types who logically exist due to their history

**Purpose:** Ensure the game engine can support the narrative space the stories create.

---

### 6. **Cross-Story Conflict Chart**

**Requirement:** Formalize relationships between characters in a matrix format.

**Deliverable:** Relationship matrix showing:
- Alliances
- Tensions
- Old debts
- Ideological clashes
- Shared losses
- Historical betrayals
- Contradictions that need resolution

**Format:**
| Character | Ally | Rival | Debt | Conflict Type | Notes |

**Action Items:**
- Map intersecting questline opportunities
- Confirm both sides of relationships agree on tone & cause
- Flag contradictions for resolution

---

### 7. **Honey/Amber Mythology Pass**

**Requirement:** Extract half-myths, whispered dangers, rituals, and legends from stories and treat them as proto-religious or scientific mysteries.

**Action Items:**
- Identify whispered dangers
- Extract outlaw rituals
- Catalog lost amber wells or honey sources
- Note vision quests or mystical experiences
- Ensure honey doesn't become "convenient miracle"
- Verify honey/amber has costs, risks, corruption mechanics

**Mechanical Requirements:**
- Limit honey power activation frequency
- Introduce cost & corruption
- Tie "visions" to mission unlocks
- Ensure physical/mental changes from use

---

### 8. **Linguistic Echoes**

**Requirement:** Extract shared idioms, slang, curses, superstitions, and cultural terms from stories.

**Action Items:**
- Identify repeating phrases or concepts
- Propose lore meaning for shared linguistic patterns
- Create glossary of cultural terms
- Ensure consistent usage across stories

**Example:** If "The Quiet Lights" appears in multiple stories → define as celestial event, slang term, or cultural tradition

---

### 9. **Factional Stakes Check**

**Requirement:** For each character, clearly define what they would die for.

**Per Character, Extract:**
- One ideology they'd die for
- One faction they'd sabotage
- One personal line they'll never cross

**Purpose:** These become alignment flags, reputation scoring, diplomatic triggers, and mission consequence trees.

---

### 10. **Canon Sources Verification**

**Requirement:** Identify vague elements that need canonization and mark placeholders for final adjudication.

**Action Items:**
- List items requiring final lore ruling
- Mark placeholders as "pending confirmation"
- Export list of canonical decisions needed

**Examples:**
- Are amber wells naturally occurring or man-made?
- Do channelers shorten their lives?
- Are void-touched feared, revered, or hunted?
- What happens to permanently mutated individuals?

---

### 11. **Cultural Roles Must Align With Gameplay**

**Requirement:** Stories should reveal species/class cultural roles that inform mechanical design.

**Action Items:**
- Identify what each species is known for culturally
- Ensure gameplay mechanics reflect narrative roles
- Check for consistency between cultural description and mechanical bonuses

**Examples:**
- Stonelocks: slow to trust, territorial, pragmatic builders → crafting/defensive bonuses
- Who is nomadic → mobility bonuses
- Who has mystic rituals → honey/amber affinity
- Who hoards honey → economic mechanics
- Who fears amber channelers → faction restrictions

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Immediate (Post-Story Completion)
1. Meta-analysis document (`STORY_UNIVERSE_INSIGHTS.md`)
2. Cross-story relationship matrix
3. Mission archetype extraction per character
4. Timeline epochal events identification

### Phase 2: Follow-Up (Before Engine Integration)
5. Power disparity review
6. Honey/Amber mythology extraction
7. Linguistic echoes glossary
8. Factional stakes formalization
9. Canon sources verification list

### Phase 3: Ongoing (During Development)
10. Bidirectional lore → engine feedback
11. Cultural roles → gameplay alignment
