## Additional Notes

### Shared Timeline Events:
- **Amber Channeling Incident (5 years ago)**: Kaelen Voss and Mara Deep-Current both present at outpost when rare Channeling occurred. Different perspectives - Kaelen saw it as confirmation of Warden mission, Mara saw it as reason to leave Wardens.

### Faction Entanglements:
- **Wardens**: Kaelen (active), Kresh (active), Mara (ex-member)
- **Horizon Combine**: Dr. Zara (active), Prism (active), Thorn (ex-member), Dr. Reth (exiled)
- **Confluence Cartel**: Lysara (active), Stalwart (active)

### Honey/Amber Exposure:
- **Mara Deep-Current**: Witnessed Amber Channeling, left Wardens as result
- **Kaelen Voss**: Same event, but stayed with Wardens (different interpretation)
- **Dr. Reth Hive-Mind**: **PERMANENTLY ALTERED** - Honey mutation research went wrong, now has heightened sensitivity to "hive consciousness" in biological systems
- **Vex Three-Stance**: Has handled Amber artifacts, scarred by near-exposure (physical scarring on primary manipulator arm)

### Stereotype Subversions Highlighted:
1. **Kaelen**: Human specialized tank (not versatile generalist)
2. **Thorn**: Stonelock sniper (not melee brawler)
3. **Lysara**: Aeshura assassin/infiltrator (not just precision shooter)
4. **Zara**: Sylarin tech scientist (not biological symbiont warrior)
5. **Mara**: Ærathi surface-world Pioneer (not aquatic-only)
6. **Vex**: Vazari precision relic hunter (not heavy weapons platform)
7. **Kresh**: Ash-Khadd battlefield support (not four-arm brawler)
8. **Stalwart**: Orm-Shun diplomat (not giant warrior)
9. **Prism**: Thalesari stealth operative (not light-combat specialist)
10. **Dr. Reth**: Yntari loner scientist (not swarm-minded collective)

### Mechanical Hooks Summary:
- **Faction Reputation Effects**: Multiple characters have faction ties that create bonuses/penalties
- **Honey Expertise**: Several characters have specialized Honey knowledge (distillation, gathering, mutation research)
- **Amber Exposure**: Multiple characters have Amber-related scars, knowledge, or experiences
- **Unique Abilities**: Each character's race/class combo creates distinct gameplay possibilities
- **Cross-Character Synergies**: Some characters naturally work together (Wardens, Combine researchers, Cartel operatives)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Roster created - **WAITING FOR USER APPROVAL**
2. Once approved: Create BIO_SUMMARIES.md (2-3 paragraphs per character)
3. Then: Begin writing full stories one at a time

**NOTE:** This roster is based on existing design docs and conversation history. Will be refined once LORE_BIBLE.md is complete to ensure full consistency with established lore.
