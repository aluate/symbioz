## HONEY MECHANICS

### What Honey CAN Do:

1. **Permanent Developmental Enhancement:**
   - When consumed during growth years (childhood/adolescence)
   - Can grant permanent stat bonuses (e.g., +1 STR from Ironflower honey)
   - Builds into character's biology over years of development
   - Effects are permanent, not temporary

2. **Temporary Performance Buffs:**
   - When consumed in adulthood
   - Grants temporary bonuses to performance
   - Examples:
     - Crag-Nectar: Extended endurance for holding positions
     - Luminescent Pollen: Sensory enhancement, perception bonuses
     - Sand-Sting: Multi-task enhancement
   - Duration: Temporary (hours to days)

3. **Native/Regular Use:**
   - Can be part of regular diet from native planets
   - Regular use maintains enhancements
   - Examples: Native populations using their planet's honey regularly

4. **Crafting and Alchemy:**
   - Can be used in crafting systems
   - Can be combined/hybridized
   - Can be used in medicine/alchemy
   - Can be used for weapon/equipment enhancements

5. **Economic Value:**
   - Can function as currency/resource
   - Trade value based on strain and rarity
   - Black market value for illegal/unprocessed forms

### What Honey CANNOT Do:

1. ❌ **Cannot be felt as physical presence years after ingestion**
   - Wrong: "honey running through his system" (years later)
   - Correct: "the strength that honey had given him" (permanent enhancement)
   - Correct: Reference the permanent enhancement, not active effect

2. ❌ **Cannot grant magical-style powers**
   - Honey is biological/enhancement-based, not magical
   - No spell-like abilities
   - No reality-warping effects

3. ❌ **Cannot "run through" people years after ingestion**
   - Effects are either permanent (developmental) or temporary (consumption)
   - No ongoing active state years later

4. ❌ **Cannot be used to control others**
   - Not mind control
   - Not possession
   - Biological enhancement only

### Honey Terminology Standardization:

**CORRECT Usage:**
- "Permanent enhancement from childhood exposure"
- "The strength that Ironflower honey had given him"
- "Felt the Ironflower-enhanced strength in his muscles"
- "Honey grants temporary bonuses when consumed"
- "Regular use maintains enhancements"

**INCORRECT Usage:**
- ❌ "Honey running through his system" (years later)
- ❌ "Felt the honey coursing through his veins" (years later)
- ❌ "Honey gave him magical powers"

## AMBER MECHANICS

### What Amber CAN Do:

1. **Reality-Warping Effects:**
   - Can bend space
   - Can alter gravity
   - Can freeze time/reality (stasis states)
   - Can affect physical matter in impossible ways
   - Can interact with biological systems in unpredictable ways

2. **Psychological Effects:**
   - Amber exposure grants psychological scars
   - Can cause enhanced perception
   - Can provide specialized knowledge or intuition
   - Can create understanding of reality-bending forces

3. **Biological System Interactions:**
   - Can alter biological systems permanently
   - Can interact with life support systems
   - Can change how biological systems function
   - Effects can be permanent

4. **Channeling Events:**
   - Rare, dangerous, unpredictable events
   - Require containment protocols
   - Can trap people in impossible states
   - Can expand if not contained

### What Amber CANNOT Do:

1. ❌ **Cannot grant "resistance" or "immunity"**
   - Wrong: "resistance to Amber"
   - Wrong: "immunity to Amber effects"
   - Correct: "survival knowledge" or "understood its dangers"
   - Amber is always dangerous, even to those who have survived exposure

2. ❌ **Cannot grant smooth acceptance**
   - Amber exposure is always traumatic
   - Always has psychological/physical consequences
   - Never becomes "easy" or "safe"

3. ❌ **Cannot be controlled easily**
   - Amber is unpredictable
   - Containment protocols have limitations
   - Cannot be safely used as a tool

4. ❌ **Cannot be synthesized or reproduced**
   - Amber is naturally occurring (or ancient origin)
   - Cannot be created by technology
   - Rare and non-reproducible

### Amber Terminology Standardization:

**CORRECT Usage:**
- "Survived Amber exposure" (not "resistance")
- "Understood its dangers" (not "resistant")
- "Psychological scars from Amber exposure"
- "Enhanced perception from Amber exposure"
- "Amber exposure grants survival knowledge"
- "Previous exposure gave understanding" (not "resistance")

**INCORRECT Usage:**
- ❌ "Resistance to Amber"
- ❌ "Immune to Amber effects"
- ❌ "Biological adaptation to Amber"
- ❌ "Smooth acceptance of Amber"

## AMBER EXPOSURE CONSEQUENCES

### Types of Exposure:

1. **Direct Physical Contact:**

   - Can trap in impossible states
   - Example: Combine researcher at Gamma-7

2. **Proximity/Energy Field:**
   - Less dangerous than direct contact
   - Can cause psychological scars
   - Can grant enhanced perception
   - Example: Witnesses to Gamma-7 event

3. **Previous Exposure (Survival):**
   - Having survived Amber exposure provides knowledge
   - Not resistance or immunity
   - Survival knowledge allows understanding of effects
   - Example: Vex's previous exposure (10 years ago)

### Effects Categories:

1. **Psychological:**
   - Scars from witnessing reality-warping
   - Enhanced perception of Amber dangers
   - Specialized knowledge or intuition
   - Understanding of reality-bending forces

2. **Physical:**
   - Permanent scars (Vex: glowing scars, phantom pain)
   - Permanent biological system alterations (station systems at Gamma-7)
   - Permanent mutations (Dr. Reth: Collective Nectar)

3. **Mechanical (Gameplay):**
   - +1 to +2 WIS bonuses for Amber-related checks
   - Enhanced threat assessment
   - Knowledge of containment protocols
   - Ability to recognize Amber-related anomalies
