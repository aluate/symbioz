## The Distance Between

The shot rang out across the docking bay. Not loud—Thorn's rifle was suppressed, modified, perfected over decades. The sound was more of a cough than a bang, a mechanical exhalation that barely registered above the station's ambient noise.

The Combine security officer dropped. One shot. Center mass. Through the viewport of a cargo hauler, from three hundred meters away, in near-darkness.

Thorn didn't move. Didn't celebrate. Didn't feel anything except the familiar weight of the rifle against his shoulder, the way his dense Stonelock frame absorbed the recoil without shifting, the way his three-point stance—two legs and his tail acting as a tripod—kept him perfectly still.

He'd been waiting for this moment for five years. Not this specific shot, but this kind of moment. A Combine officer, doing Combine work, hurting people who couldn't fight back. Thorn had spent twenty years wearing that uniform, following those orders, being part of the machine. Now he was the bullet that broke it.

He chambered another round. There were three more officers in the bay. They'd scattered, taken cover, started calling for backup. Thorn had time. He always had time. That was the advantage of distance, of precision, of being a Stonelock who'd learned that sometimes the strongest thing you could do was stay perfectly still and let the bullet do the moving.

He took another breath. Adjusted his aim. Waited for the target to expose themselves.

The distance between him and them was more than meters. It was years of betrayal, of broken promises, of realizing you'd been the weapon pointed at the wrong people. The distance was everything.

Thorn was born in the deep mines of Deepstone, a Stonelock colony world where the planet's dense core made mining both necessary and dangerous. His people were built for it—dense bones, compact frames, bodies that could withstand pressure and impact that would kill other races. The expectation was simple: you grew up, you went into the mines, you became strong enough to survive the work.

But Thorn was different. Even as a child, he was smaller than other Stonelocks, more compact. His frame was dense but not broad, his muscles tight rather than bulky. In the mines, where strength meant being able to lift, to carry, to withstand, he was adequate but never exceptional.

What he was exceptional at was stillness.

The mines taught him that. In cramped tunnels where a wrong move could trigger a collapse, where sound could mask danger, where patience was more valuable than speed, Thorn learned to become motionless. He could hold a position for hours. Could wait without fidgeting. Could watch without being noticed.

His first weapon was a modified mining tool—a pneumatic drill refitted to fire compressed air projectiles. He'd built it himself, spending months scavenging parts, learning how pressure systems worked, understanding that distance was safety. He practiced in abandoned tunnels, shooting at targets he'd painted on rock walls, learning to compensate for his low mobility by eliminating threats before they could reach him.

The Crag-Nectar honey his people used for mining stamina helped. It didn't make him faster—nothing could do that for a Stonelock—but it gave him endurance. He could hold a firing position for hours without fatigue, could maintain perfect stillness while his body processed the honey's effects, could wait for the perfect shot without his muscles complaining.

By the time he was eighteen, he was the best shot in his mining district. Not because he was naturally talented, but because he'd learned that precision came from patience, and patience came from understanding that sometimes the best defense was being too far away to hit.

When Horizon Combine recruiters came to Deepstone looking for security personnel, they weren't looking for miners. They were looking for people who could hold positions, who could follow orders, who could be reliable. Thorn applied. He was twenty-two, tired of mining, ready for something that used his actual skills.

The Combine offered him a contract: steady work, better pay, access to proper weapons systems. They promised he'd be protecting people, maintaining order, doing important work. Thorn believed them. He signed the contract, took the uniform, and spent the next twenty years learning how wrong he'd been.

---

Combine security work wasn't what he'd expected. It wasn't about protection. It was about control. About maintaining corporate interests. About making sure workers stayed workers, that protests stayed small, that resistance stayed manageable.

Thorn did his job. He followed orders. He held positions. He eliminated threats—or what Combine called threats, which often meant workers asking for better conditions, or settlers on land Combine wanted, or anyone who stood in the way of corporate expansion.

He told himself he was protecting people. That the order he maintained prevented chaos. That the stability he enforced was better than the alternative. He told himself a lot of things, and for twenty years, he believed them.

His reputation grew. Thorn Ironhand, the Stonelock sniper who never missed. The one who could hold a position for days, who could eliminate targets from impossible distances, who could be relied upon to follow orders without question. Combine promoted him. Gave him better equipment. Made him a squad leader.

He was forty-two when the order came.

A settlement on the edge of Combine territory. Officially, it was an illegal squat on corporate property. The residents needed to be removed. The settlement needed to be cleared. Standard procedure.

Thorn's squad was assigned. Six security officers, all experienced, all reliable. They'd done this before. Clear out squatters, relocate them, secure the property. Routine.

But when they arrived, Thorn saw something that didn't match the briefing. The "squatters" weren't transients or opportunists. They were families. They were farmers. They had documentation showing they'd owned the land for three generations, before Combine had claimed it through legal manipulation, before corporate lawyers had found loopholes in old property laws.

The settlement leader showed Thorn the papers. Explained how Combine had seized the land through technicalities. How they'd been fighting the seizure for years. How the courts had ruled against them because Combine had better lawyers, more money, more influence.

Thorn read the documents. Listened to the stories. Looked at the faces of people who'd built lives on land that was being taken from them.

He'd seen this before. Dozens of times. Hundreds. He'd been part of it. He'd followed orders, cleared settlements, removed people from land Combine wanted. He'd told himself it was legal, that it was necessary, that the people would be relocated and compensated.

But this time, something broke.

He looked at his squad. Six officers, ready to follow his orders. Ready to clear out families, to destroy homes, to remove people from land they'd worked for generations. He looked at the settlement. At the children playing in the dirt. At the fields they'd cultivated. At the lives they'd built.

He made a choice.

Thorn refused the order. Not quietly. Not privately. Publicly. In front of his squad, in front of the settlement, in front of Combine's local representative who'd come to oversee the operation.

"I won't do this," he said. "These people have rights. This is wrong."

The representative tried to reason with him. Tried to explain the legal situation. Tried to remind him of his contract, his duty, his position. Thorn listened. And then he repeated himself.

"I won't do this."

His squad was confused. Some tried to convince him. Some questioned his judgment. But Thorn had made his decision. He ordered his squad to stand down. Told them to return to base. Told them he'd take responsibility.

He did. Combine discharged him dishonorably. Blacklisted him from legitimate employment. Took his uniform, his equipment, his pension. Left him with nothing except his personal rifle—the one he'd modified himself, the one Combine couldn't claim because he'd built it before he joined—and a burning need to make them pay.

Not through violence. Not through revenge. Through precision. Through targeting their operations, disrupting their supply lines, making their expansion more difficult. Through being the bullet they couldn't stop because they never saw it coming.

Five years passed. Thorn built a reputation as an independent operator, a precision sniper who could eliminate targets from impossible distances, who could hold positions for days, who could be hired for jobs that required patience and precision.

He specialized in Combine operations. Not because he hated them—though he did—but because he knew them. Knew their procedures, their security protocols, their weaknesses. Knew how to exploit the systems he'd once defended.

He operated from The Spindle, a semi-legal waystation where factions intersected and deals were made. It was a good base of operations: central location, multiple factions, enough chaos that a freelance operator could work without too many questions.

He'd heard about the Warden stationed there—Kaelen Voss, a human Vanguard who maintained order and protected civilians. Thorn respected that. The Wardens had their own problems, their own compromises, but at least they tried to protect people. At least their mission wasn't corporate profit.

Thorn kept his distance. He didn't need Warden attention, and the Warden didn't need to know about his operations. They existed in parallel, both working from The Spindle, both trying to make things better in their own ways, both aware of each other's presence without needing to interact.

His current job was simple: disrupt a Combine supply convoy. The Combine was shipping weapons to a corporate security outpost, and Thorn's client—a resistance group—wanted the shipment delayed or destroyed. Thorn's role was to eliminate the convoy's security escort, creating an opening for the resistance to strike.

He'd been waiting for three days. The convoy was scheduled to pass through a narrow asteroid field, and Thorn had positioned himself on a small rock, his rifle set up, his position camouflaged, his body perfectly still. The Crag-Nectar honey he'd taken that morning was still working, giving him the endurance to maintain his position without fatigue.

The convoy appeared. Three ships, moving in formation, security escorts visible. Thorn counted targets. Six security officers, spread across the ships, positioned to defend against boarding attempts.

He'd planned this. Knew the formation. Knew the timing. Knew exactly where each target would be when the ships entered his firing range.

He took the first shot. The lead ship's security officer dropped. Before the others could react, he'd taken two more. The convoy broke formation, ships scattering, security officers taking cover.

Thorn didn't move. Didn't celebrate. Just chambered another round, adjusted his aim, waited for the next target to expose themselves.

This was what he was good at. Not mining. Not following orders. Not being part of a system that hurt people. This. Precision. Distance. The ability to eliminate threats before they could cause harm, to protect people by removing the things that would hurt them.

The resistance group struck while the convoy was disorganized. They boarded the ships, secured the weapons, disabled the vessels. Thorn watched through his scope, providing overwatch, eliminating any security officers who tried to resist.

When it was over, the resistance had what they needed. The Combine convoy was neutralized. The weapons wouldn't reach the corporate outpost. People who needed those weapons to defend themselves now had them.

Thorn packed up his rifle. Moved to his extraction point. Returned to The Spindle.

He didn't feel triumphant. He felt tired. Felt the weight of twenty years of following wrong orders, of being part of a system that hurt people. Felt the distance between who he'd been and who he was now.

But he also felt something else: purpose. Not the false purpose Combine had sold him, but real purpose. The knowledge that he was using his skills to help people who couldn't help themselves, to disrupt systems that needed disrupting, to be the bullet that broke the machine.

That was enough. For now, that was enough.
