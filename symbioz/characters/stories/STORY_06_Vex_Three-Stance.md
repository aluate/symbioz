## The Weight of Artifacts

Vex examined the Amber fragment through her multiple optic arrays, each eye providing a different perspective, a different wavelength of analysis. The fragment was small, no larger than her primary manipulator, but its energy signature was unmistakable. Ancient. Powerful. Dangerous.

She'd seen Amber before. Had handled it. Had been scarred by it. Ten years ago, while examining an active Amber core, the artifact had flared. Her primary manipulator arm had been caught in the energy discharge, leaving permanent scars that glowed faintly in the dark and caused periodic phantom pain.

But she'd survived. Had learned from it. Had developed a respect for Amber's power that others lacked.

This fragment was different. Smaller. More contained. But no less dangerous. She could feel its energy through her tripodal stability, through the way her three legs and multiple optic arrays processed the world. The fragment resonated with something in her Vazari physiology, something that recognized Amber as both threat and opportunity.

Vex was a Reclaimer. Her job was to locate and recover Amber artifacts from derelict stations, crashed ships, forgotten worlds. She'd been doing it for twenty years. Had recovered more Amber fragments than anyone alive. Had deciphered more ancient inscriptions. Had located more lost Channeler sites.

But she'd also learned that Amber wasn't just a resource. It wasn't just a tool. It was a force that operated outside normal physics, that could unmake reality, that demanded respect rather than control.

Her current contract was from a Warden team. They needed someone who could identify and safely handle an Amber fragment that had been discovered at an outpost. Someone who understood the dangers. Someone who could help contain it.

Vex took the contract. Not because she needed the money—though she did—but because she believed that Amber artifacts belonged in the right hands. Not in the hands of those who would weaponize them. Not in the hands of those who would exploit them. But in the hands of those who understood their power and respected their danger.

She'd seen what happened when Amber fell into the wrong hands. Had seen researchers frozen in impossible stasis. Had seen reality bend around artifacts that shouldn't exist. Had seen the consequences of trying to control forces that couldn't be controlled.

Her scars were a reminder. Not just of the danger, but of the respect that Amber demanded. Of the understanding that some forces were beyond comprehension, beyond control, beyond the categories that the universe normally used.

That understanding was what made her valuable. Not just her ability to locate artifacts, but her ability to handle them safely, to understand their power, to ensure they ended up in the right hands.

That was her purpose. That was her calling. That was enough.

Vex was born on Tri-Station Gamma, a Vazari outpost where her people's tripodal physiology made them natural platforms for heavy weapons and stable firing positions. Her people were expected to become warriors, to use their three legs and multiple optic arrays for combat, to become the kind of stable firing platforms that could hold positions against superior forces.

But Vex rejected that path. Not because she didn't understand it—she did, better than most—but because she was fascinated by something else: the past. Specifically, the artifacts left behind by ancient civilizations, the technology that had been lost, the Amber fragments that held power beyond understanding.

Her tripodal stability gave her something warriors didn't have: perfect stillness for delicate work. Her multiple optic arrays gave her perspectives that others missed. Her ability to hold positions for hours without moving made her perfect for examining artifacts, for deciphering inscriptions, for understanding technology that had been forgotten.

She became a Reclaimer. Not just someone who found artifacts, but someone who understood them. Who could read ancient inscriptions. Who could decode lost technology. Who could handle Amber fragments safely, with the respect they demanded.

Her Metallic-Ash honey exposure—native to Tri-Station Gamma, part of her people's regular diet—enhanced her ability to interface with ancient machine systems. She could connect with technology that had been lost for centuries, could understand systems that others couldn't decode, could see the patterns in artifacts that seemed random.

By the time she was thirty, she was one of the best Reclaimers in the Reach. She'd recovered more Amber fragments than anyone alive. Had deciphered more ancient inscriptions. Had located more lost Channeler sites. Her reputation made her valuable to every faction that needed someone who could handle dangerous artifacts safely.

But her success came at a cost. Ten years ago, while examining an active Amber core on a derelict station, the artifact had flared. Vex's primary manipulator arm had been caught in the energy discharge. The scars were permanent. They glowed faintly in the dark, caused periodic phantom pain, and served as a constant reminder that Amber's power was beyond comprehension.

But she'd survived. Had learned from it. Had developed a respect for Amber's danger that others lacked. Had understood that some forces couldn't be controlled, only respected.

Five years ago, she'd been hired by a Warden team to help with an Amber fragment discovered at Outpost Gamma-7. The fragment had been embedded in an asteroid chunk, pulled into the station's docking bay during routine operations.

Vex had identified it immediately. The energy signature was unmistakable. Ancient. Powerful. Dangerous. She'd recommended immediate containment, had helped set up quarantine protocols, had called for backup.

But before the containment could complete, a Combine research team had forced their way into the docking bay. They wanted the artifact. They had authorization, they claimed. They had a mandate.

Vex had tried to secure the artifact before either side could reach it. Had tried to get it into proper containment. Had tried to prevent the confrontation that was about to happen.

But she'd been too slow. One of the Combine researchers had touched the artifact directly.

The world bent.

Vex felt it differently than the others. Not just as reality warping, but as Amber's energy recognizing something in her physiology. Her previous exposure had given her survival knowledge—not immunity, but understanding. She could feel the energy's effects, could sense how it was warping reality, could understand what was happening in ways that others couldn't.

The Combine researchers froze. Not just stopped—froze in a way that Vex recognized from her studies of Amber artifacts. They existed in a state between life and death, preserved in a moment of contact with something that operated outside normal physics.

The artifact's energy field expanded. Touched the station's outer hull. The metal stopped being entirely real. The energy was spreading, was warping reality in ways that containment protocols might not fully control.

Vex had tried to help. Had tried to explain what was happening. Had tried to assist with containment. But the Wardens had their protocols. Tessa, the other Vanguard, had activated the emergency containment systems. The section had been sealed. The artifact, the frozen researchers, and the warped reality had been locked away.

Later, when the Amber-handling specialists arrived, they'd confirmed what Vex already knew: the researchers existed in an impossible state, preserved in contact with something that shouldn't exist. The artifact had been contained, but the damage was done. The researchers were lost. The station's systems had been altered. The reality of that section would never be entirely normal again.

Vex had helped with the aftermath. Had provided her expertise. Had helped the Wardens understand what had happened, what the artifact was, how it could be handled safely.

But she'd also learned something. That containment wasn't enough. That protocols weren't sufficient. That Amber's power was beyond the categories that normal physics used, beyond the methods that normal systems employed.

She'd continued her work. Recovering artifacts. Deciphering inscriptions. Locating lost sites. But she'd also become more careful. More respectful. More aware that some forces couldn't be controlled, only understood.

Now she operated from The Spindle as an independent contractor. She worked for whoever paid best, but she had her own agenda: locating and securing Amber artifacts before the major factions could abuse them. Her tripodal stability gave her precision that other Reclaimers couldn't match. Her Vazari network connections meant she heard about new discoveries before most factions did.

She'd played all sides against each other, always staying one step ahead, always protecting the artifacts from those who would misuse them.

Her scars were a reminder. Not just of the danger, but of the respect that Amber demanded. Of the understanding that some forces were beyond comprehension, beyond control, beyond the categories that the universe normally used.

That understanding was what made her valuable. That was her purpose. That was her calling.

For now, that was enough.

## GAMMA-7 AMBER CHANNELING EVENT - CANONICAL RECAP

**Event Date:** 5 years ago  
**Location:** Outpost Gamma-7 (small research station in asteroid belt)  
**Participants:** 
- Kaelen Voss (Human Vanguard) - Defensive line
- Tessa (Warden Vanguard) - Team leader, made containment decision
- Mara Deep-Current (Ærathi Pioneer - Warden at time) - Biological system analysis
- Vex Three-Stance (Vazari Reclaimer) - This character, discovered the artifact

**Sequence of Events:**
1. **Vex discovered Amber fragment** embedded in asteroid chunk during routine sweep - her unique role as Reclaimer
2. Artifact pulled into station's docking bay, immediately caused system glitches (lights flickering, gravity fluctuations)
3. **Vex identified it immediately** - energy signature unmistakable, recommended immediate containment
4. Vex helped set up quarantine field, called for backup, began evacuation procedures
5. Combine research team forced way into docking bay, bypassed security
6. **Vex tried to secure the artifact** before either side could reach it, tried to get it into proper containment
7. Confrontation: Kaelen and Tessa formed defensive line, Mara positioned to disable equipment, Vex tried to secure artifact
8. **Combine researcher touched artifact directly** - triggered Amber Channeling event before Vex could secure it
9. Reality warped: space folded, light curved impossibly, gravity inverted repeatedly, machines shorted out
10. **Vex's unique perspective:** Felt Amber's energy recognizing something in her physiology due to previous exposure. Her survival knowledge allowed her to understand what was happening in ways others couldn't.
11. Combine researchers frozen in literal stasis - not dead, not alive, preserved in moment of contact
12. Artifact's energy field expanded, touched station's outer hull, metal stopped being entirely real
13. Tessa activated emergency containment protocols, sealed entire docking bay section
14. Containment field engaged, artifact's energy stabilized, section locked until Amber-handling specialists arrived
15. Vex helped with aftermath, provided expertise, helped Wardens understand what happened
16. Researchers confirmed to exist in impossible state between life and death

**Character's Role in Event:** 
Vex discovered the Amber fragment embedded in the asteroid chunk during routine sweep. Identified it immediately by energy signature. Recommended immediate containment. Helped set up quarantine protocols. Tried to secure the artifact before the confrontation could happen, but was too slow - Combine researcher touched it first. Provided unique perspective due to previous Amber exposure, understood what was happening. Helped with containment and aftermath, provided expertise to Wardens.

**Character's Interpretation:** 
Recognized the artifact immediately from energy signature. Understood the danger from previous exposure. Tried to prevent the confrontation by securing the artifact first. Her previous exposure gave her survival knowledge that helped her understand the reality-warping effects. Learned that containment protocols weren't always sufficient, that Amber's power was beyond normal physics. Continued work but became more careful and respectful of Amber's power.

**Post-Event Consequences:**
- **Immediate:** Helped with containment and aftermath procedures
- **Long-term:** Continued Reclaimer work but with increased caution and respect for Amber's power
- **Character's path:** Operating from The Spindle as independent contractor, works for whoever pays but has agenda of protecting artifacts from misuse
- **Specialized knowledge:** Enhanced understanding of Amber dangers, +2 WIS bonus for Amber-related analysis

**Mechanical Implications:**
- **Amber exposure effects:** Previous exposure (10 years ago) plus Gamma-7 event provide deep understanding of Amber dangers
- **Permanent changes:** +2 WIS bonus for Amber-related analysis and handling, enhanced artifact recovery skills
- **Specialized knowledge:** Deep understanding of Amber artifacts, safe handling protocols, ability to identify energy signatures
