## B. MECHANICAL CONSISTENCY CHECK

### ✅ PASSED: All Mechanics Verified

**Race/Class Alignment:**
- ✅ Ash-Khadd traits: Four arms, multi-task capability, battlefield control - correctly represented
- ✅ Warden class: Protection, defense, order maintenance - correctly represented
- ✅ Stereotype subversion: Ash-Khadd as battlefield support (not four-arm brawler) - clearly established

**Stat Justifications:**
- ✅ High CON: Ash-Khadd biology, dense frame (justified)
- ✅ Moderate STR/WIS: Four arms provide capability, Warden training (justified)
- ✅ Low DEX: Not built for mobility, defensive positioning (justified)

**Honey Mechanics:**
- ✅ Sand-Sting: Multi-task enhancement - correctly used for simultaneous coordination
- ✅ Usage pattern: Native/regular use for battlefield control (appropriate)

**Amber Exposure:**
- ✅ Amber Channeling event (5 years ago): Witnessed aftermath, different rotation - correctly established
- ✅ Indirect exposure: Understands dangers without direct contact - appropriate

**No Issues Found**

## C. CROSS-STORY CONSISTENCY CHECK

### ✅ PASSED: Cross-Character References

**The Spindle Connection:**
- ✅ Kaelen Voss (Story #1): Both Wardens at The Spindle, story mentions awareness - aligns with Kaelen's story
- ✅ Other operators: Story mentions awareness of Thorn, Lysara, Zara - appropriate
- ✅ All operate from same location, maintain boundaries - matches established pattern

**Mara Deep-Current Relationship (Story #5):**
- ✅ Story establishes complicated relationship - mutual respect but disagreement
- ✅ Both witnessed Gamma-7 event (Kresh from different rotation) - timeline aligns
- ✅ Kresh stayed with Wardens, Mara left - correctly established different choices
- ✅ Emotional weight: Respect but disagreement about methods - appropriate

**Outpost Gamma-7 Reference:**
- ✅ Story notes Kresh was on different rotation, witnessed aftermath - APPROPRIATE (doesn't contradict, adds perspective)
- ✅ Timeline: 5 years ago - matches other stories
- ✅ Understood both perspectives (containment worked, but methods questioned) - appropriate

**No Conflicts Found:**
- ✅ No timeline contradictions
- ✅ No faction stance contradictions
- ✅ Character relationships align with established backgrounds
- ✅ The Spindle connections handled appropriately

**Future Story Notes:**
- When writing other Warden characters, ensure awareness of Kresh's presence at The Spindle
