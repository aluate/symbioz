## B. MECHANICAL CONSISTENCY CHECK

### ✅ PASSED: All Mechanics Verified

**Race/Class Alignment:**
- ✅ Vazari traits: Tripodal stability, multiple optic arrays, precision work - correctly represented
- ✅ Reclaimer class: Artifact recovery, inscription deciphering, Amber expertise - correctly represented
- ✅ Stereotype subversion: Vazari as precision relic hunter (not heavy weapons platform) - clearly established

**Stat Justifications:**
- ✅ High INT: Reclaimer class + Vazari multiple perspectives (justified)
- ✅ High WIS: Understanding of Amber dangers, ancient knowledge (justified)
- ✅ Low STR/DEX: Not built for combat, precision focus (justified)

**Honey Mechanics:**
- ✅ Metallic-Ash: Machine interface enhancement - correctly used for ancient technology analysis
- ✅ Usage pattern: Native/regular use for tech interface (appropriate)

**Amber Exposure:**
- ✅ Previous exposure (10 years ago): Scarred by energy discharge - correctly established
- ✅ Amber Channeling event (5 years ago): Witnessed at Gamma-7 - correctly established
- ✅ Resistance/survival knowledge: Previous exposure gave understanding - appropriate

**No Issues Found**

## C. CROSS-STORY CONSISTENCY CHECK

### ✅ CRITICAL: Amber Channeling Event Alignment

**Shared Event - Outpost Gamma-7 (5 years ago):**

**Event Details - MUST MATCH Kaelen's Story (#1) and Mara's Story (#5):**
- ✅ Location: Outpost Gamma-7 - MATCHES
- ✅ Team composition: Kaelen, Tessa (Vanguard), Mara (Pioneer), Vex (Reclaimer) - MATCHES
- ✅ **Artifact discovery: Vex discovered Amber fragment in asteroid chunk** - MATCHES (this is Vex's unique role)
- ✅ Combine team: Forced way into docking bay - MATCHES
- ✅ Researcher touch: Combine researcher touched artifact directly - MATCHES
- ✅ Reality warping: Space folded, gravity inverted, machines shorted - MATCHES
- ✅ Researchers frozen: Literal stasis, not dead/alive - MATCHES
- ✅ Containment: Tessa activated protocols, sealed section - MATCHES
- ✅ Timeline: Event 5 years ago - MATCHES

**Vex's Unique Perspective - CORRECTLY DIFFERENT:**
- ✅ **Artifact discovery role**: Vex found the fragment - UNIQUE TO VEX, adds to story
- ✅ **Reclaimer expertise**: Identified energy signature immediately - APPROPRIATE
- ✅ **Previous exposure knowledge**: Understood what was happening from experience - APPROPRIATE
- ✅ **Tried to secure artifact**: Attempted to get it into containment before confrontation - ADDS DEPTH
- ✅ **Helped with aftermath**: Provided expertise to Wardens - APPROPRIATE

**Previous Amber Exposure (10 years ago):**
- ✅ Story establishes earlier Amber exposure that scarred her
- ✅ This explains her "survival knowledge" mentioned in Kaelen's story
- ✅ Timeline: 10 years ago (before Gamma-7 event) - no conflicts
- ✅ Scars on primary manipulator arm - matches bio summary

**No Conflicts Found:**
- ✅ Core event facts align perfectly with Kaelen and Mara's accounts
- ✅ Vex's unique role (discovering artifact) adds depth without contradicting
- ✅ Different perspectives enhance rather than contradict
- ✅ Timeline consistent across all three stories

**The Spindle Connection:**
- ✅ Operates from The Spindle as independent contractor - correctly established
- ✅ Works for multiple factions - matches bio summary
- ✅ Potential connections to all characters via contracts - appropriate

**No Conflicts Found**

## D. STORY QUALITY CHECK

### ✅ PASSED: Structure and Tone

**Word Count:** ~2,100 words ✅ (within target 1,800-2,600)

**Structure Assessment:**
- ✅ Opening Scene (~300 words): Strong, shows character examining artifact, establishes expertise
- ✅ Childhood/Early Years (~400 words): Tri-Station Gamma background, rejecting warrior path, becoming Reclaimer
- ✅ Adolescence/Education (~350 words): Developing Reclaimer skills, artifact recovery expertise
- ✅ Young Adulthood/First Missions (~400 words): Building reputation, previous Amber exposure (10 years ago)
- ✅ Crisis/Turning Point (~400 words): Amber Channeling event at Gamma-7 - the defining moment, her role in discovery
- ✅ Recent History (~250 words): Current operations, independent contractor work
- ✅ Mechanical Notes: Complete and detailed

**Tone Assessment:**
- ✅ Dark CDA tone achieved: Gritty, realistic, no perfect heroes
- ✅ Moral ambiguity present: Works for whoever pays, but has own agenda to protect artifacts
- ✅ Frontier sci-fi realism: Artifact hunting, ancient technology, independent contractor economy
- ✅ No meta commentary: Story stays in-universe throughout
- ✅ Emotional weight: Scars as reminder, respect for Amber's power, understanding of danger
- ✅ Philosophical undercurrent: Questions about control vs respect, understanding vs exploitation

**Writing Quality:**
- ✅ Show, don't tell: Actions demonstrate Reclaimer expertise
- ✅ Minimal dialogue: Only essential internal monologue
- ✅ Sparse prose: No purple language, grounded descriptions
- ✅ Character growth: Clear arc from warrior path rejection to Reclaimer mastery
