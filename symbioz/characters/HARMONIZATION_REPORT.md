## Executive Summary

All 10 character stories have been validated for cross-story consistency. **No contradictions found.** All shared events, timelines, character relationships, faction stances, and locations align perfectly across all stories.

---

## A. Shared Events Validation

### ✅ Outpost Gamma-7 Amber Channeling Event (5 years ago)

**Stories Involved:** 01 (Kaelen), 05 (Mara), 06 (Vex), 07 (Kresh - aftermath)

**Event Details - PERFECTLY ALIGNED:**

| Element | Story 01 (Kaelen) | Story 05 (Mara) | Story 06 (Vex) | Story 07 (Kresh) | Status |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Event Date** | 5 years ago | 5 years ago | 5 years ago | 5 years ago | ✅ MATCH |
| **Location** | Outpost Gamma-7 | Outpost Gamma-7 | Outpost Gamma-7 | Outpost Gamma-7 | ✅ MATCH |
| **Initial Team** | Kaelen, Tessa, Mara, Vex | Kaelen, Tessa, Mara, Vex | Kaelen, Tessa, Mara, Vex | (different rotation) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Artifact Discovery** | Vex discovered it | Vex discovered it | Vex discovered it | (witnessed aftermath) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Who Touched Artifact** | Combine researcher | Combine researcher | Combine researcher | (aftermath only) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Reality Warping** | Space folded, gravity inverted | Space folded, gravity inverted | Space folded, gravity inverted | (aftermath only) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Researchers' Fate** | Frozen in stasis | Frozen in stasis | Frozen in stasis | (witnessed aftermath) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Containment** | Tessa activated protocols | Tessa activated protocols | Tessa activated protocols | (witnessed protocols) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Timeline** | 5 years ago | 5 years ago, Mara left 1 month after | 5 years ago | 5 years ago, witnessed aftermath | ✅ MATCH |

**Character-Specific Perspectives - CORRECTLY UNIQUE:**
- ✅ **Kaelen:** Defensive line, saw containment as necessary, stayed with Wardens
- ✅ **Mara:** Biological system perspective, saw containment as wrong approach, left Wardens 1 month after
- ✅ **Vex:** Discovered artifact, tried to secure it, provided Reclaimer expertise
- ✅ **Kresh:** Different rotation, witnessed aftermath only, saw both perspectives

**Validation Result:** ✅ **PERFECT ALIGNMENT** - All four stories match on core event facts while maintaining unique character perspectives.
