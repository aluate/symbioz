# Character Stories Prompt - Quick Reference

## What This Prompt Does

This Cursor prompt will generate **10 canonical character stories** for Symbioz that:

1. ✅ **Cover all 10 races and 8 classes** (unique combinations)
2. ✅ **Include full life stories** (1,800-2,600 words each)
3. ✅ **Cross-validate against each other** (ensures consistency)
4. ✅ **Link to game mechanics** (weapons, stats, factions, Honey/Amber)
5. ✅ **Match Dark CDA tone** (gritty, frontier, realistic)
6. ✅ **Pass devil's advocate reviews** (before finalizing)

## Key Features

### Cross-Story Validation ✅

**YES - The prompt explicitly requires:**

- Checking each new story against ALL previously written stories
- Ensuring shared events are acknowledged appropriately
- Resolving timeline conflicts
- Maintaining faction consistency across all stories
- Tracking character relationships (who knows who, who should know who)
- Harmonizing Honey/Amber incidents across stories

**Example:** If Character #2 and Character #7 both experienced "The Spindle Incident," their stories must:
- Reference the same event (even if perspectives differ)
- Acknowledge each other if they met
- Have consistent consequences
- Align with the timeline

### Word Count Requirements ✅

**Strict enforcement:**

- **Full Stories:** 1,800 - 2,600 words each (10 stories total)
- **Biographical Summaries:** 200-300 words each (10 summaries)
- **Roster Table:** Table format only (concise entries)

### Writing Instructions ✅

**Comprehensive guidance on:**

- **Structure:** Opening → Childhood → Adolescence → Young Adulthood → Crisis → Present
- **Tone:** Dark CDA style (gritty, frontier, no perfect heroes)
- **Style:** Show don't tell, minimal dialogue, sparse prose
- **Mechanics:** Every story must link to gameplay systems
- **Rules:** No meta commentary, no fourth-wall breaks
- **References:** KOTOR 2, The Expanse, Andor, Taylor Sheridan

### Quality Controls ✅

**Multiple validation layers:**

1. **Per-Story Devil's Advocate:** Before finalizing each story
2. **Cross-Story Checks:** Each new story validated against all previous ones
3. **Final Report:** Complete consistency map across all 10 stories

### Mechanical Anchoring ✅

**Every story must include:**

- Stat modifiers from backstory
- Faction reputation effects
- Honey/Amber exposure consequences
- Weapon/armor/implant access
- Skill specialties
- Mission type suitability
- All in a "Mechanical Notes" section at the end
