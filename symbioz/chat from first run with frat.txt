I'm going to take a little break from working. I think we've made some good progress on the websites and auto and all that shit. But I had a thought about something, and I'm going to freestyle it, and then you go nuts and tell me how we can do it. So, I really like the video game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you know, from 2000, 2003, Knights of the Old Republic 2. And I've played different mods on them, and I think it's all well and good and fun. But I think one of my favorite things was the simple Dungeons and Dragons combat system. And then as you level up, you know, your attributes and your skills and all that. Like, I think that they set it up perfectly so that you can play the game as this build or that build. And I think somewhere in between, you know, Knights of the Old Republic and today, I'm just surprised we haven't had, like, a live-action D&D simulator. And I thought, well, you know, I don't really need that. I think it would be fun to have a game like Knights of the Old Republic where I get to level up. I use a party. There's crafting where I can upgrade my weapons and armor, but only by unlocking certain skill trees. And I really like that Knights of the Old Republic didn't have, like, a perk system per se. They had feats, but not perks. So it wasn't like Fallout where you follow the tree up and you can't build this gun until you have that perk. You gotta get to that level. And then I thought, well, shit, there's a lot of, like, ROM hacks and shit like that where people can plug in and play whatever. Like, Pokemon games, there's gotta be a million of them. So I guess my real question is, how hard would it be to essentially have, like, a new, like, you know, where we could, I don't know, where I could play a game and level up a character and beat a big boss? I guess what I want to do is play D&D. I just want to lean on the Knights of the Old Republic engine, but be able to play different levels and have different characters. And maybe I could do a co-op. Or maybe the whole fucking thing is text-based, because that's easy. You know, and we just find an interface that dresses it up and we do some Oregon Trail bullshit. But how would we go about building something like that?
You said:
Shit, I guess we could really build the, if we're gonna lean on the text base, which I think is fine, then we can build our own little rule book, right, and we can code it from there, and that'll, you know, some sort of a blend of Skyrim, Dungeons & Dragons, Knights of the Old Republic, Fallout, Pokemon, all that fucking shit, all that fun stuff, and to be able to kind of create a codified the rules, the fucking rules. We create the rules. Here's the list of classes. Here's the list of weapons. Here's the list of that. Here's the buffs that these guys get. Here's the nerfs that these guys get. So I guess our first question should be, you know, do we want to lean on the sci-fi or fantasy? And I think that we should lean on sci-fi. I just think it's going to be more fun to be flying around in a spaceship with my crew, and we can jump in and out of the ship, and do shit, and you know, top from one planet to the next. We got to go kill this crime boss. Oh, who are the major players? You know, where's the criminal element? Who are the nations that were stuck in between? That kind of a shit. You know, how does magic work? How does the ranged weapons work? You know, what's next?
You said:
So I think we need to go just a shade past mid-sci-fi, but not all the way into the blending of fantasy. I just really think that there needs to be real, actual magic, but it needs to be really, actually rare. Like, maybe we get one companion that can actually use it, like a Jedi, but the player character doesn't have that option. Because that's been done before. As for the psionics, that's kind of Mass Effect-y. And I just think if we're going to use technology to create the Force, we need to just use the Force. So I think that there's people who can have implants that enhance their already existing physical capabilities. You know, something like Cyborg from Teen Titans, where he's really just a dude, but he's plugged in. And he can do shit, but because of the machines. But because of the machines, he's more than capable. And I think that we need to have playable alien races. And I just don't know exactly how many we need. Maybe we start with three or four, and we lean on the archetypes from D&D. You know, here's a human, here's a dwarf, here's an elf. And we just say, alright, that's what people are familiar with, so that's where we'll start. I also like the idea of having some sort of... Like a stand-in for Spice, or whatever shit from some of the other franchises. But I think it should be Honey. And I think that because bees' honey changes based on the pollen that they use, I think that the honey should have different effects based on the planet that they're cultivated on. And some of them make you stronger, and some of them make you stoned, and some of them kill you. But that could be our brewing arm, and our medicine arm would be manipulating the honey. Yeah, so let's move on from there. Some of my favorite weapons... I mean, you know, swords are badass. Lightsabers are the greatest. Upgradable rifles. Can I build just a pistol and then we do it way up? So the pistol we start with can get upgraded throughout the game, or we find some unique weapons out in the world akin to some of the higher-level unlocks from Knights of the Old Republic 2, like whatever the Mandalorian assault rifle is that is fully upgradable and then has another perk on top of it. I don't want legendary weapons like from Fallout. I think it's fine to just unlock them the deeper you get in the game. You can hold vendors behind level ups. And I think that there needs to be a hard cap, like from KOTOR 1, where it was a hard cap at 20. But I think we need to put the hard cap at, like, 30. And kind of trace that progression and set it up so that, you know, at the end, you've got your team of, you know, three or four, and you're all level 30 and you're battling a level 50 boss and you've upgraded and min-maxed whatever the shit you did. Yeah.
You said:
So, for the magic frequency, it really needs to feel more like the Bendu from Star Wars Rebels. Where, when they come up on him, he can do a lot of shit. But then he's gone, and no one's quite sure where he came from or where he went. But I love the idea of Amber being required. So it's kind of like, if there was no magic in Skyrim, and the only option you had was to wield through a staff. But the only way to wield through a staff is to have a feat, which is restricted, so that only certain races can have it at all. And they can only get there if they've completed prerequisites. So maybe it's a feat restricted to a race and hidden behind a quest. So we could have a companion who is able to use magic, but not until over halfway through the story. And then, you know, I'm fine with having a really kind of... It doesn't have to be expansive, but having a typical sort of a spellbook. You know, here's our damage, here's our support. Where do we stick this guy in the battle? Is he out in front? Is he in the back? And I think we should be able to do both. The honey effects logic, I love the idea of having... Yeah, I know for sure that when we've got this flower on this planet, we're going to get this kind of honey. But what happens if we mix these ones, and we can have the little pockets there? So there have to be the easy ones we can get, and then the hard ones that show up later. And I think that some of our energy weapons and things like that can be based off of... You know, the sentient species trying to recreate magic by synthesizing amber. And the result is energy, which is stable enough, but it's not magic. So that's where we can blend some of the magic and some of this. You know, we're cooking them up, and they don't really work that great, but they still kind of work. And then for the weapon chassis, I think if we set them all up like the lightsaber upgrades from Knights of the Old Republic 2, where we can have two different crystals, plus a color, because we love cosmetics. But the color, I guess, doesn't matter on a text game. And then we can have, you know, here's the lens. So that's where we focus the light. Here's the source of the light. And then here's the battery, I guess, that changes the stuff. But I think it'd be cool if we could have six upgrade slots, and maybe some of them are locked. You need to have somebody who has a certain feat. And if somebody doesn't have the right feat, maybe they can build it, but they can't wield it. So make it hard. And then you said something, this is on a totally separate thing, about symbiotic. And I think that there should be interactions. Like when somebody with this implant is on the field at the same time as somebody with that implant, they passively buff each other or something like that. So we can get interesting combinations. But say, you know, we get an elf and a dwarf on the field at the same time. And the dwarf has, you know, his upgrade paths. And the elf has his, so the dwarf can't do the precision upgrade, but the elf can. But if the dwarf has, like, his big buff, and the elf dedicates some of his time from the back, helping increase his aim, you know what I mean? But the elf can't use the implant, and the dwarf can't use the implant. But when the two are together, they can lean into each other.
You said:
We need to separate the weapons into different types and that's going to define what their six things are called. So I think we need ballistic and energy to be one of the distinctions and then within that we need to have classes like pistol, rifle, sword, hammer, you know, explosive, and kind of gear it around that. And, you know, based off of that we can decide what the inside parts are called because it doesn't really make sense for a vibro sword to have an energy lens, right? As for the magic unlocks and stuff, yeah, let's lock them behind specific events or specific locations, maybe kind of like the standing stones. You can only have so many at a time. It only works that kind of way. And, you know, we don't need to be super specific with when and how because that's character specific. And right now we're working on building the system and the engine and we don't need to have specific characters. I think some obvious archetypes will arrive when we start to actually put it all together. So go ahead and put all that together and show me the system MD!
You said:
Boy, that was a lot of stuff. So, I have some thoughts. One of them is we haven't discussed armor and armor classes. So I think we need to dial that in. I think there was some confusion on what I meant by weapon types. And by that, I mean we should have, I don't know, weapon shapes. And then from there, damage types. So I guess pistol would be a shape. Rifle would be a shape. Explosive would be a shape. Melee would be a shape. And then within them, we'd have the damage types breaking them off. So we could have either an energy hammer or a regular hammer. And that's the difference between energy and ballistic. And we could have energy or ballistic explosive weapons. Some of them are guns, like rocket launchers. And some could be landmines. And some could be grenades. Maybe we've got a flamethrower. And I really think that we need to be able to gather ingredients related to honey so that we can use it to create more unique combinations. You know, if we had, we don't need 100 different types of honey that we can combine. But if we could get to, you know, 20 types of honey that we can combine, two or three or four kinds, I think that gives us enough permutations that we could create enough unique effects. And honey can be the driver for all of that, all the medicine, all of the weapon upgrades, and to some extent, the currency. But I think that there should actually still be a non, just like a credit, like a dollar. Give me a dollar. And that'll give us a little more flexibility there. And then we've got armor, which we've alluded to with implants and cybernetics. But I think we need to identify what the wearable slots are and what classes can use what types of armor or implants. Similar to Knights of the Old Republic, how Baal-Dur could never wear heavy armor because the feat was restricted because of his class, which was tech specialist. So if we had those kinds of things defined too, then we could say, yeah, a tech specialist can use all the best implants, but they can't use all the best armor. So we have to make it difficult to create, and not difficult, we have to make it a rewarding challenge to create a useful kit. And I think we'll get a lot of that with the symbiosis between certain implants and certain species. Similar to how Kreia and the player character could receive buffs back and forth when they wouldn't normally affect the whole team because of their force bond or whatever it is. And I think if we create more opportunities for that naturally through species relations and then unnaturally through implants, it'll give us more options.
You said:
Let's do that, but bear in mind that we still have cursor and auto. So if we can use what we have here to craft another prompt, including on this one having your devil's advocate's view of what we have in front of us, what's missing, what would make this more interesting for me to play sitting on my couch? Then I think that we would be in the money.
You said:
I want more playable races, and I want better definition of classes. Because I think that it would be really interesting if we could have a unique... You know, dwarves are always melee, they're always the tinkerer, elves are always the ranger, and always that. But I think if we had, you know, eight playable races, kind of like Skyrim, I think we could make an interesting contradiction to what's normal. Where we end up with a dwarf who's actually an incredible sniper, you know? He just can't run very fast, so he got good at shooting from a long ways. But I think that the way to get that role down there... I just don't know if we have all the species there now with straight-up analogs, or if we need... You know, we have the cereal, but maybe we leave the dwarf, human, earthling all as mostly humanoid. And then we make five that are less humanoid. You know, one that's, like, underwater. You know, a fish guy, and then a... You know, a couple other kinds of things. Do you know what I mean?
You said:
10 races, 8 classes
You said:
Let's make that final class kind of a combination of the three you put there and kind of call them like pioneer or they just got to know how to actually interact with the world. You know, oh these plants do this and these animals do that and well this kind of tree will work for an axle and that kind of tree won't. And have them be people who specialize not so much in you know things that intelligent races have done but just the way that the world evolved you know a pioneer or a naturalist or something like that. And you know I think we have enough here that we have some classes and races that definitely are going to be more useful outside of combat than inside of combat. But the only way to you know the only way we ever get to this one planet is if we have a diplomat that's good enough and our pioneer was able to successfully save this one flower during this one mission and because he was he took the honey and had a vision. So even if they never see combat they still do shit.
