## 📚 How to Use These Documents

### When You Need Something Fast:
1. **Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Common tasks cheat sheet
2. **Find command/tool** - Instant answer

### Before Creating New Code:
1. **Check `SKILLS_LIBRARY.md`** - Does a utility already exist?
2. **Check `PROBLEM_SOLUTION_REGISTRY.md`** - Has this problem been solved?
3. **Extend existing** rather than create new

### When You Have a Problem:
1. **Search `PROBLEM_SOLUTION_REGISTRY.md`** - Solution documented?
2. **Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Common fix?
