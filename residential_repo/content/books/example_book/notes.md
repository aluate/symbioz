# Editing Notes - Example Book

Notes taken while listening to audio renders.

## Chapter 1

- [ ] Check pacing on DAD's first line - might be too slow
- [ ] BAD_GUY voice needs more menace
- [ ] Consider adding pause after "Not yet."

## Chapter 2

- [ ] LITTLE_GIRL laughter needs to be more distant/echoey
- [ ] DAD's line about mom - maybe add slight pause before "would have"

## General Notes

- Overall pacing feels good
- Voice differentiation is clear
- Need to add more stage directions for emotional beats
