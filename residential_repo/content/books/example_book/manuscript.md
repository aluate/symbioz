## Chapter 1

The wind curled around the ridge like a slow exhale. Karl stood at the edge of the clearing, watching the last light fade behind the mountains.

"Son, you don't build a cabin to escape life. You build it to face it."

The voice came from behind him. He turned to see his father standing in the doorway of the half-built structure.

"You really think you're still in control?" The question came from the shadows, cold and low.

Karl's hand moved toward his side, but he stopped. This wasn't the time. Not yet.

## Chapter 2

The morning brought clarity. The little girl's laughter echoed through the trees, a sound that shouldn't have been there. Not this far from town.

"Your mom would have loved this place," his father said, joining him at the fire.

Karl nodded, but said nothing. Some truths were better left unspoken.
