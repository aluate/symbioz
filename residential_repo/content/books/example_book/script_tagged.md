## Chapter 1

[NARRATOR]
The wind curled around the ridge like a slow exhale. Karl stood at the edge of the clearing, watching the last light fade behind the mountains.

[DAD, calm, slower]
"Son, you don't build a cabin to escape life. You build it to face it."

[NARRATOR]
The voice came from behind him. He turned to see his father standing in the doorway of the half-built structure.

[BAD_GUY, low, cold]
"You really think you're still in control?"

[NARRATOR]
The question came from the shadows, cold and low.

[NARRATOR]
Karl's hand moved toward his side, but he stopped. This wasn't the time. Not yet.

## Chapter 2

[NARRATOR]
The morning brought clarity. The little girl's laughter echoed through the trees, a sound that shouldn't have been there. Not this far from town.

[DAD, calm]
"Your mom would have loved this place," his father said, joining him at the fire.

[NARRATOR]
Karl nodded, but said nothing. Some truths were better left unspoken.
