# Stax — Module Catalog

**Note**: This is a framework for the Stax module catalog. Actual dimensions, floorplans, and specifications should be finalized based on engineering requirements, transport constraints, and market demand.

## Module Philosophy

### Design Principles

- **Modern, Flat-Roof Architecture**: Clean lines, big windows, contemporary aesthetic
- **Highway-Legal Sizes**: Modules sized for standard transport (typically 14' wide, variable length)
- **Engineered for Stacking**: Modules can be stacked or connected horizontally
- **Grid Cabinet Integration**: Standardized interiors using Grid cabinet SKUs
- **Options Packages**: Tied to Sugar Mountain spec tiers (Quartz, Garnet, Sapphire)

## Next Steps

1. Finalize module dimensions (based on transport constraints and engineering)
2. Develop detailed floorplans for each module type
3. Define options packages (Quartz/Garnet/Sapphire details)
4. Set pricing based on cost analysis
5. Create visual catalog (renderings, floorplans)
6. Build quoting tool/system
7. Develop connection details for multi-module homes
