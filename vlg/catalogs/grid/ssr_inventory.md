# Grid Cabinet Systems — Strategic Stock Reserve (SSR)

## Overview

The Strategic Stock Reserve (SSR) is Grid's material inventory buffer designed to protect production schedules and enable the QuickBuild™ program.

---

## Purpose

### Primary Goals

1. **Schedule Protection**: Eliminate material delays that cause production schedule slips
2. **QuickBuild™ Enablement**: Maintain material buffer for 4–7 day QuickBuild orders
3. **Supply Chain Resilience**: Buffer against supplier delays, shortages, or disruptions
4. **Customer Reliability**: Deliver on promised lead times, even when suppliers are delayed

### Problem Solved

**Typical Cabinet Shop Problem**:
- Material orders take 1–2 weeks
- Supplier delays cause production delays
- Production delays cause customer schedule slips
- Customer schedule slips = lost business, reputation damage

**Grid Solution**:
- SSR maintains material buffer
- Production never waits for materials
- Schedules are protected
- Customers get reliable delivery

## SSR Structure

### Material Categories

**Melamine Sheet Goods**
- 5 core colors (QuickBuild colors)
- Standard sheet sizes (4×8, 5×10, etc.)
- Minimum stock levels per color
- Re-order triggers

**Edgebanding**
- Matching edgeband for 5 core colors
- Standard widths
- Minimum stock levels
- Re-order triggers

**Hardware**
- Hinges (soft-close, standard)
- Slides (soft-close, standard)
- Handles (2 standard styles)
- Fasteners and assembly materials
- Minimum stock levels
- Re-order triggers

### Inventory Levels

**Target Buffer Size**:
- Enough material to build ~2 full kitchens at any time
- Covers typical QuickBuild order size
- Provides buffer for standard orders
- Accounts for supplier lead times

**Per-Color Levels**:
- Minimum stock per color (to be determined based on usage)
- Maximum stock (to avoid over-investment)
- Re-order point (trigger for new orders)
- Safety stock (buffer above re-order point)

## SSR Management

### Inventory Tracking

**Tracking System**:
- Real-time inventory levels
- Usage tracking (what's being used)
- Re-order alerts
- Supplier lead time tracking

**Key Metrics**:
- Current stock levels (by color, by material type)
- Usage rate (materials used per week/month)
- Re-order frequency
- Stock-out events (should be zero)

### Re-Order Process

**Re-Order Triggers**:
- Stock level drops to re-order point
- Automatic re-order (if system enabled)
- Or: Manual re-order based on alerts

**Re-Order Quantities**:
- Economic order quantity (EOQ) considerations
- Supplier minimums
- Storage capacity
- Cash flow considerations

**Supplier Relationships**:
- Preferred suppliers for fast restock
- Backup suppliers (if primary is delayed)
- Volume pricing (if applicable)
- Lead time agreements

### Inventory Turnover

**Target Turnover**:
- SSR inventory should turn regularly
- Not sitting idle for months
- Balance between buffer and efficiency

**Optimization**:
- Adjust levels based on actual usage
- Seasonal adjustments (if applicable)
- Demand forecasting
- Supplier performance tracking

## SSR and QuickBuild™

### How SSR Enables QuickBuild™

**Material Availability**:
- QuickBuild orders use SSR materials
- No waiting for material orders
- 4–7 day lead time is achievable
- Schedule protection is real

**Production Efficiency**:
- Materials ready = production starts immediately
- No production delays = faster completion
- Predictable process = reliable delivery

### SSR Requirements for QuickBuild™

**Minimum Stock Levels**:
- Must maintain enough for typical QuickBuild order
- Must cover 5 core colors
- Must include hardware buffer
- Must account for supplier lead times

**Re-Order Discipline**:
- Must re-order before stock-out risk
- Must maintain safety stock
- Must track usage accurately
- Must have backup suppliers

## SSR Costs

### Capital Investment

**Inventory Value**:
- Material cost of SSR inventory
- Tied-up capital
- Opportunity cost

**Storage Costs**:
- Storage space (rack space, floor space)
- Material handling
- Inventory management time

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Costs**:
- Capital tied up in inventory
- Storage costs
- Management time
- Risk of obsolescence (minimal with 5-color core)

**Benefits**:
- Schedule protection = customer retention
- QuickBuild enablement = premium pricing potential
- Reduced rush costs = margin protection
- Supply chain resilience = competitive advantage

**ROI**:
- Value of schedule protection (customer retention, reputation)
- Value of QuickBuild premium pricing
- Value of reduced rush costs
- Value of competitive advantage

## SSR Optimization

### Continuous Improvement

**Monitor and Adjust**:
- Track actual usage vs. projections
- Adjust stock levels based on demand
- Optimize re-order points
- Improve supplier relationships

**Demand Forecasting**:
- Track usage patterns
- Forecast future demand
- Adjust SSR levels accordingly
- Plan for seasonal variations (if applicable)

**Supplier Performance**:
- Track supplier lead times
- Identify reliable suppliers
- Develop backup suppliers
- Negotiate better terms (volume, lead times)

---

## SSR Expansion

### Future Considerations

**Potential Expansions**:
- Additional colors (if demand justifies)
- Additional material types (if needed)
- Regional SSR (if multiple locations)
- Builder-specific SSR (for large partners)

**Scaling SSR**:
- As production scales, SSR may need to scale
- Balance between buffer and efficiency
- Maintain discipline (don't over-invest)

## Next Steps

1. Determine actual SSR inventory levels (based on usage projections)
2. Set up inventory tracking system
3. Establish re-order processes
4. Build supplier relationships
5. Launch SSR program
6. Monitor and optimize
