## How It Works

### 1. Design to QuickBuild™

**Grid Support**:
- Provide QuickBuild SKU catalog

- Suggest alternatives if custom items needed

### 2. Order Process

**Standard Process**:

3. Grid provides quote (QuickBuild pricing)
4. Buyer approves and pays deposit
5. Order enters QuickBuild queue
6. Production (4–7 days)
7. Completion notification
8. Pickup or delivery

**QuickBuild Queue**:
- Dedicated production slots
