## Supply Chain Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Reliability Over Price**: Consistent, on-time delivery is more valuable than lowest price
2. **Local When Possible**: Support local suppliers, reduce transport costs, faster response
3. **Backup Suppliers**: Always have backup options to avoid single points of failure
4. **Strategic Relationships**: Build long-term relationships with key suppliers
5. **Volume Leverage**: Use ecosystem volume to negotiate better terms
