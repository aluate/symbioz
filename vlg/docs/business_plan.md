# Valhalla Legacy Group — Business Plan

## Executive Summary

Valhalla Legacy Group is a private holding & development entity that quietly operates behind three specialized operating companies:

- **Sugar Mountain Builders (SMB)** — High-end GC, spec homes, land development
- **Stax™** — Modular housing manufacturing (single modules + multi-box homes)
- **Grid Cabinet Systems** — Fast-turn, CNC-driven melamine cabinet manufacturing

Together, they form a vertically integrated ecosystem that:
- Controls supply chain
- Reduces build times
- Lowers cost of goods sold
- Creates repeatable, modularized housing products
- Delivers consistent, high-margin units
- Removes subcontractor bottlenecks
- Stabilizes production
- Builds long-term assets

Valhalla owns the land, buildings, industrial sites, modular yards, and equipment, while each operating company owns its brand and IP — preserving the ability to spin off or sell any division independently.

## Brand Architecture

- Quiet owner/developer
- Holds real estate, factories, equipment
- Finances expansion phases
- Not consumer-facing

### Sugar Mountain Builders (SMB)
- GC & spec home division
- Customer-facing
- Luxury/precision builder
- Executes land improvements for Valhalla
- Installs Stax homes
- GC on all modular installs
- Builds partnership homes (JV)

### Stax™
- Modular manufacturing division
- Modern prefab units (ADUs, single modules, multi-module homes)
- Speed, precision, affordability
- Factory-forward
- Works with SMB for installs
- Supplies product for Valhalla's spec pipeline

### Grid Cabinet Systems
- CNC cabinet division
- Fast-turn melamine systems

## Market Opportunity

The Inland Northwest faces:
- Chronic housing shortages
- Rising labor costs
- Limited subcontractor availability
- Long build timelines
- Lack of modern modular supply
- Unpredictable cabinet lead times
- Outdated factory-built housing options
- A nearly empty ADU market

You solve this through:
- **Stax**: Modern modular inventory
- **Grid**: Fast-turn cabinet systems
- **SMB**: GC + development
- **Valhalla**: Land & industrial asset ownership

This positions you to dominate:
- ADU market
- Small cabin market
- Modular workforce housing
- Tiny homes / rental units
- Accessory apartments
- Spec-home development
- Small builder partnerships
- Rural housing
- Mountain living trends

## The Vertical Integration Flywheel

### 1️⃣ Grid Cabinet Systems → supplies
- Stax modular units
- Sugar Mountain spec homes
- Retail remodel market

### 2️⃣ Stax Modular → supplies
- SMB with modular homes
- Other builders
- JV spec partners
- Valhalla developments

### 3️⃣ SMB (Sugar Mountain Builders) → installs
- Stax homes
- Grid cabinets
- All Valhalla development work

### 4️⃣ Valhalla Legacy Group → owns
- Land
- Buildings
- Equipment
- Modular yards
- Utility infrastructure
- Industrial improvements

And the cycle repeats.

This creates **margin stacking** AND **timeline reduction**, the two biggest levers in construction.

- Frameless Euro construction
- Builder-focused product line

**Role in the ecosystem**:
- Reduces modular lead times
- Eliminates cabinet subcontractor delays
- Supports spec home production
- Provides retail cashflow

**Sellable?** Yes — Grid stands alone as a profitable casework shop.

### Stax™ Modular

**Purpose**: Manufacture modern, fast-turn, prefab modular homes.

**Strategy**:
- Flat-roof modern silhouettes
- ADUs, single-box, two-box, three-box homes

- Factory assembly + SMB installation

**Role in the ecosystem**:
- Provides repeatable, scalable housing units
- Creates install revenue for SMB
- Creates cashflow assets for Valhalla

### Sugar Mountain Builders

**Purpose**: GC + installs + land development + spec home builder.

**Strategy**:
- Build spec homes using Stax units where possible
- Build custom homes for premium clients
- Install and finish-out Stax units

**Purpose**: Own the empire's assets without being front-facing.

**Strategy**:
- Buy land
- Develop industrial sites
- Build the cabinet shop
- Build the modular yard
- Build the modular factory

- Long-term holds
- Investor partnerships

### Margin Stack
- Grid → Stax → SMB → Valhalla

- Cuts timelines by 50–70%
- Enables production of 30–200 modular units annually

## Exit or Liquidity Options

Because each division owns its own IP:
- **Grid** can be sold to another shop or conglomerate
- **Stax** can be acquired by a modular manufacturer
- **SMB** can be folded into a larger GC
- **Valhalla** retains the real estate and keeps building wealth

This is "modularized entrepreneurship" — the empire is designed to be broken apart or grown at will.

---

## Next Steps

1. Execute Phase 0 and Phase 1 (Grid launch, SMB expansion)
2. Identify and acquire land (Phase 2)
3. Build first facility (Phase 3)
4. Launch Stax prototype yard (Phase 4)
5. Scale to full factory (Phase 5)
6. Build prototype village (Phase 6)
7. Pursue 200-unit builder partnership (Phase 7)
