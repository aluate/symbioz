# Complete Fix - Ready to Implement

I understand what needs to be done:

1. **Fix drag/drop** - Calculate positions, use collision detection
2. **Collision detection** - Rooms push each other  
3. **Floor filtering** - UI to filter by level
4. **Roof modules** - Added to library ✅
5. **Multi-story rooms** - Vaulted ceilings, staircases

**I've created:**
- ✅ floorPlanUtils.ts with collision functions
- ✅ FloorFilter component
- ✅ Updated RoomLibrary with roof modules
- ✅ Updated data structures

**Now implementing the complete FloorPlanBuilder with all fixes...**

This is a comprehensive update that will:
- Fix drag/drop to properly calculate positions
- Add collision detection that pushes rooms
- Add floor filtering UI
- Handle multi-story rooms
- Support roof modules

**Creating the complete working version now!**
