# Comprehensive Fix Summary

You asked for:
1. Fix drag/drop (not working)
2. Collision detection (rooms push each other)
3. Floor filtering (Level 1, 2, or Both)
4. Roof modules (gable, shed, hip)
5. Multi-story rooms (vaulted ceilings, staircases)

## What I'm Implementing:

✅ **Data structures updated** - Added roof types, multi-story support
✅ **Collision utilities created** - floorPlanUtils.ts with all collision functions

🔧 **Next - Fix FloorPlanBuilder:**
