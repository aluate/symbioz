# Forge Site — Product Control Document

## What Forge Site Is

Forge Site is a calm, professional, modular website system. It takes a simple business profile, selects proven templates and page modules, and generates a clean, modern, high-converting website ready to deploy. No chaos. No guesswork. Just a clear path from business data to a live site.

## Who It's For

Small and mid-sized business owners who need a professional web presence without the overhead:

- Builders and trades
- Local service professionals
- Small shops and boutiques
- Designers and creatives
- Light e-commerce sellers
- Service firms

These are people who want to look credible online but don't want to become web developers.

## Core Promise

**Get seen. Stay simple.**

Forge Site delivers:

- Clean, professional websites without chaos
- Fast delivery built on tested modules and templates
- Sites that work and can be edited later without breaking
- A calm process that doesn't overwhelm

## Tagline

**"Get seen. Stay simple."**

## Tech Stack Overview

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Templates:** Modular page components assembled from a registry
- **Build System:** TypeScript scripts that ingest JSON and generate sites
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready output
- **Content:** Static JSON configs (no database required initially)

## Automation Integration

Otto and other automation tools are internal workers. They run the build scripts, validate configs, and execute the generation pipeline. They are not the customer-facing brand.

Forge Site is the product customers see and buy. Otto is the engine that builds it.

## Roadmap

### v1: Template + Module Static Site Generator
- JSON intake system
- Template selection logic
- Module assembly pipeline
- Copy generation in Forge Site voice
- Brand token application
- Next.js site output

### v2: Basic CMS or Configuration UI
- Web-based config editor
- Image upload and management
- Content preview before build
- Version control for site configs

### v3: Multi-Tenant Hosting / White-Label Agency Tooling
- Agency dashboard
- Client portal
- White-label options
- Recurring subscription management

## Architecture Principles

- **Modular:** Everything is a composable module
- **Template-Driven:** Proven layouts assembled from modules
- **Data-Driven:** Business JSON drives all content
- **Brand-Consistent:** Tokens applied automatically
- **Voice-Consistent:** Copy follows Forge Site tone (Karl + Hemingway)

## Value Proposition

For business owners: A professional website in days, not months. No technical headaches. Clear pricing. Ongoing support available.

For the business: High-margin, repeatable service. Fast delivery. Scalable system. Premium positioning.
