# Forge Site — Sales Pitch

## The Problem

Building a website shouldn't be a nightmare.

Most business owners face two bad options:

**Option 1: DIY tools**
- Drag and drop until you're lost
- Templates that look like everyone else's
- You're still the webmaster
- It breaks when you touch it

**Option 2: Agencies**
- Months of back and forth
- Expensive custom builds
- You're locked in
- Changes cost a fortune

Neither works for busy people who just want to look professional online.
