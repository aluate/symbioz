## Problem / Pain

Most websites are a mess.

You try to build it yourself. You get lost in drag-and-drop tools. Nothing looks right. You spend hours and it still looks amateur.

Or you hire an agency. Months go by. Meetings stack up. The price keeps climbing. You're locked into a system you don't understand.

Neither works.

You just want a website that looks professional and gets the job done. Without the headache.

## How Forge Site Works

**Step 1: You fill in a short form.**

Tell us about your business. What you do. Where you work. What you want the site to accomplish. Simple questions. Plain answers.

**Step 2: We build your site.**

Our system picks the right template. Assembles proven modules. Writes clear copy. Applies professional styling. All based on what you told us.

**Step 3: You review, we tune, we launch.**

You see the site. We make adjustments. We deploy it. You're live.

That's it. Days, not months.
