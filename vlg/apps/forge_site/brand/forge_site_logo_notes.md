# Forge Site Logo Notes

## Symbol Direction

The Forge Site logo symbol should evoke:

- **Clarity** - Clean, simple geometry
- **Simplicity** - Minimal strokes, no clutter
- **Speed** - Directional, forward motion
- **Structure** - Framing, boundaries, order

## Symbol Ideas

### 1. Minimal Angled "Forge Corner"
A simple right-angle bracket representing structure, framing, and clean edges.

```
┐   or   ⌟
```

**Brand vibe:** "We give your business a strong edge"

### 2. Single Forward Line + Dot
Speed + clarity. Start → finish. Simple journey, clean outcome.

```
—• 
```

### 3. Abstract Outline Frame
Thin, geometric rectangle or hex outline. Stable, modern, architectural.

```
☐
```

Matches the "frame your site into clarity" message.

### 4. Upright Triangle
Direction, refinement, upward growth. Not aggressive, more like a drafting symbol.

```

```

## Logo Requirements

### Must Avoid
- Flames
- Literal hammers or tools
- Honeycomb patterns (too industry-specific)
- Aggressive or chaotic elements

### Must Include
- Clean geometry
- Minimal line weight (1.25–1.75px)
- Directional feeling
- Professional, calm presence

## FS Badge Usage

The two-letter "FS" badge should:

- Work as a monogram
- Be readable at small sizes (24px, 48px, 96px)
- Interlock F and S softly, or keep them neutral and geometric
- Use modest line weights
- Serve as internal tech + product identity marker

## Color Applications

Logo should work in:

- **Steel Blue** (#5D7586) - Primary brand color
- **Graphite** (#2F3136) - Dark variant
- **Porcelain** (#F4F2EC) - Light variant for dark backgrounds
- **White knockout** - For dark hero sections
- **Black** - For print/monochrome

## Typography Pairing

Logo wordmark should pair with:

- Inter (primary)
- Plus Jakarta Sans (alternative)
- Clean, humanist sans-serif
- Medium weight for wordmark
- Avoid ultra-black bolds

## Usage Guidelines

- Minimum clear space: width of the symbol on all sides
- Don't stretch or distort
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Use symbol-only for favicons and small spaces
- Use full lockup (symbol + wordmark + tagline) for marketing materials
- Use horizontal lockup (no tagline) for app headers and footers
