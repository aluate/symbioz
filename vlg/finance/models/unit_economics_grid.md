# Grid Cabinet Systems — Unit Economics

**Note**: This document outlines the cost structure and margin framework. Actual pricing and margins should be determined based on local market conditions, material costs, and competitive analysis.

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs (Monthly)

**Facility**
- Lease or facility costs (allocated from Valhalla)
- Utilities (power, compressed air, water)
- Insurance
- Maintenance

**Labor (Fixed Portion)**
- Shop manager / operations lead
- Base payroll for core team
- Benefits (if applicable)

**Overhead**
- Marketing
- Administrative
- Software / tools
- Professional services

---

### Variable Costs (Per Job)

**Materials**
- Melamine sheet goods (5-color core line)
- Edgebanding material
- Hardware (hinges, slides, pulls, soft-close)
- Fasteners and assembly materials
- Packaging (if shipping)

**Labor (Variable Portion)**
- CNC operator time
- Edgebander operator time
- Assembly time
- QC and pack time
- Overtime (if applicable)

**Direct Job Costs**
- Delivery / shipping (if applicable)
- Special handling
- Rush fees (if applicable)

---

## Pricing Structure

### Standard Jobs

**Base Pricing Model**
- Cost-plus margin (target margin range)
- Per-linear-foot pricing (for standard SKUs)
- Per-SKU pricing (for catalog items)
- Custom quote for non-standard

**Margin Targets**
- Standard jobs: target margin range
- QuickBuild™: potentially lower margin, higher volume
- Custom / one-off: higher margin

---

### QuickBuild™ Program

**Economics**
- Faster turnaround = premium pricing potential
- Lower customization = lower labor cost
- Higher volume potential = better material pricing
- SSR buffer = material cost stability

**Pricing Strategy**
- Competitive with standard lead times
- Premium vs. custom shops
- Volume discounts for repeat builders

---

## Strategic Stock Reserve (SSR)

**Purpose**
- Protect schedules from material delays
- Enable QuickBuild™ program
- Buffer against supply chain issues

**Cost Structure**
- Capital tied up in inventory
- Storage space
- Material handling
- Risk of obsolescence (minimal with 5-color core)

**Value**
- Schedule protection = customer retention
- QuickBuild™ enablement = premium pricing
- Reduced rush costs = margin protection

---

## Margin Stacking (Ecosystem Benefit)

**Internal Sales to Stax**
- Transfer pricing (at cost or slight margin)
- Reduces Stax COGS
- Creates ecosystem efficiency

**Internal Sales to SMB**
- Standard pricing (or slight discount)
- Reduces SMB project costs
- Creates margin capture within ecosystem

**External Sales**
- Full market pricing
- Primary revenue driver
- Independent profitability

---

## Key Metrics

**Per-Job Metrics**
- Material cost per job
- Labor hours per job
- Total cost per job
- Revenue per job
- Margin per job
- Margin percentage

**Operational Metrics**
- Jobs per month
- Average job size
- QuickBuild vs. standard mix
- Utilization rate (CNC, edgebander, labor)
- On-time delivery rate

**Financial Metrics**
- Monthly revenue
- Monthly costs (fixed + variable)
- Monthly profit
- Cash flow timing
- Inventory turnover

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Monthly Fixed Costs**
- Sum of all fixed costs

**Contribution Margin per Job**
- Revenue per job minus variable costs per job

**Break-Even Jobs**
- Fixed costs ÷ contribution margin per job

**Target Volume**
- Break-even + target profit margin
- Accounts for seasonality
- Accounts for growth

---

## Growth Economics

**Scaling Considerations**
- Additional equipment capacity
- Additional labor (fixed vs. variable)
- Material purchasing power (volume discounts)
- Facility expansion needs

**Efficiency Gains**
- Learning curve improvements
- Process optimization
- Equipment upgrades
- Automation opportunities

---

## Competitive Positioning

**Grid Advantages**
- Fast turnaround (QuickBuild™)
- Predictable pricing
- Standardized SKUs
- SSR protection

**Pricing Strategy**
- Competitive with custom shops on lead time
- Premium vs. big-box (quality + service)
- Value-based pricing (schedule protection)

---

## Next Steps

1. Gather actual material costs (local suppliers)
2. Time studies for labor costs
3. Competitive pricing research
4. Build detailed Excel model
5. Test pricing scenarios
6. Model QuickBuild™ economics separately
