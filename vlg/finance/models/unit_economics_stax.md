# Stax Modular — Unit Economics

**Note**: This document outlines the cost structure and margin framework. Actual pricing and margins should be determined based on local market conditions, material costs, transport costs, and competitive analysis.

---

## Cost Structure (Per Module)

### Materials

**Structure**
- Lumber (framing, sheathing)
- Insulation
- Roofing materials
- Siding / exterior finish
- Windows and doors
- Flashing and weatherproofing

**Interior**
- Grid cabinets (internal cost from Grid)
- Flooring
- Drywall / interior finish
- Paint
- Trim and millwork
- Fixtures (bath, kitchen)

**MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing)**
- Electrical rough-in materials
- Plumbing rough-in materials
- HVAC components (if included)
- Appliances (if included in spec tier)

**Other**
- Fasteners and hardware
- Sealants and adhesives
- Packaging / protection for transport

---

### Labor

**Production Line Labor**
- Floor deck assembly
- Wall panel assembly
- Roof assembly
- Window/door installation
- MEP rough-in
- Interior finish
- QC and final prep

**Indirect Labor**
- Production engineer / manager
- QC lead
- Procurement
- Transport coordination

**Labor Allocation**
- Direct labor per module
- Indirect labor allocation
- Overhead allocation

---

### Overhead (Per Module Allocation)

**Facility**
- Lease or facility costs (from Valhalla)
- Utilities
- Maintenance
- Insurance

**Equipment**
- Depreciation / lease costs
- Maintenance

**Administrative**
- Management
- Sales / marketing
- General and administrative

---

### Transport & Set

**Transport Costs**
- Trucking / transport
- Permits (oversize loads)
- Escort vehicles (if needed)
- Insurance during transport

**Set Costs** (typically handled by SMB or partner GC)
- Crane rental
- Set crew
- Site coordination

**Note**: Set costs may be separate line item or bundled into module price depending on sales model.

---

## Pricing Structure

### Single Module Homes

**Base Module Price**
- Materials + labor + overhead + margin
- Transport included or separate
- Set included or separate

**Options Packages**
- Quartz tier (base)
- Garnet tier (mid)
- Sapphire tier (premium)
- Pricing differential per tier

---

### Multi-Module Homes

**Pricing Model**
- Base price per module
- Connection / integration cost
- Volume discount (if applicable)
- Site work separate (via SMB)

---

## Margin Stacking (Ecosystem Benefit)

**Grid Cabinets**
- Internal cost from Grid (at cost or slight margin)
- Reduces Stax material costs
- Creates ecosystem efficiency

**SMB Installation**
- SMB charges customer for install
- Stax sells module only (or module + install package)
- Margin captured at SMB level

**Valhalla Land / Facility**
- Stax leases facility from Valhalla
- Reduces capital requirements for Stax
- Creates asset value for Valhalla

---

## Key Metrics

**Per-Module Metrics**
- Material cost per module
- Labor hours per module
- Total cost per module
- Revenue per module
- Margin per module
- Margin percentage

**Operational Metrics**
- Modules per month (production capacity)
- Average modules per home
- Options package mix
- On-time delivery rate
- Quality metrics (defects, rework)

**Financial Metrics**
- Monthly revenue
- Monthly costs (materials + labor + overhead)
- Monthly profit
- Cash flow timing
- Inventory (modules in production)

---

## Production Economics

### Prototype Yard (Phase 4)

**Capacity**
- 2–3 modules per month (initial)
- Limited by bay space
- Learning curve period

**Economics**
- Higher cost per module (learning, inefficiency)
- Lower volume = higher overhead allocation
- Focus on validation and process refinement

---

### Full Factory (Phase 5)

**Capacity**
- Target: 200+ modules per year
- ~15–20 modules per month (steady state)
- Potential for higher with optimization

**Economics**
- Lower cost per module (efficiency, volume)
- Better material pricing (volume discounts)
- Lower overhead allocation per module
- Higher utilization of equipment

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Monthly Fixed Costs**
- Facility costs
- Fixed labor
- Overhead

**Contribution Margin per Module**
- Revenue per module minus variable costs per module

**Break-Even Modules**
- Fixed costs ÷ contribution margin per module

**Target Volume**
- Break-even + target profit margin
- Accounts for seasonality
- Accounts for growth phases

---

## Growth Economics

**Scaling Considerations**
- Additional production lines
- Additional labor (fixed vs. variable)
- Material purchasing power (volume discounts)
- Facility expansion needs
- Transport partnerships (volume discounts)

**Efficiency Gains**
- Learning curve improvements
- Process optimization
- Equipment upgrades
- Standardization improvements

---

## Competitive Positioning

**Stax Advantages**
- Modern design (flat-roof, contemporary)
- Fast installation (factory-built efficiency)
- Integration with Grid (interior quality)
- Ecosystem support (SMB install, Valhalla land)

**Pricing Strategy**
- Competitive with site-built (on total cost)
- Premium vs. traditional modular (design + quality)
- Value-based pricing (speed + reliability)

---

## Revenue Streams

**Direct Sales**
- Homeowners (via SMB or direct)
- Builders (volume purchases)
- Developers (community projects)

**JV Spec Homes**
- Stax supplies modules
- Valhalla/SMB develop site
- Profit share model

**Partnership Models**
- Builder partnerships (200-unit builder)
- Volume pricing
- Guaranteed production slots

---

## Next Steps

1. Gather actual material costs (local suppliers)
2. Time studies for production line labor
3. Transport cost research (local vs. regional)
4. Competitive pricing research (modular vs. site-built)
5. Build detailed Excel model
6. Model different production volumes
7. Model options package economics
