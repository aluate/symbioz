# Cash Flow Model Outline

**Note**: This document outlines the structure for a 3–5 year cash flow model. Actual numbers should be built in Excel or financial modeling software.

---

## Model Structure

### Time Periods
- Monthly for first 2 years
- Quarterly for years 3–5
- Annual summary

### Entities Modeled
- Valhalla Legacy Group (holding company)
- Sugar Mountain Builders (SMB)
- Grid Cabinet Systems
- Stax Modular

---

## Revenue Streams

### Valhalla Legacy Group

**Revenue Sources**
- Facility lease income (from Grid and Stax)
- Land lease income (if applicable)
- Spec home sales (long-term holds, then sales)
- Prototype village rentals (AirBnB, model home)
- Asset appreciation (not cash flow, but value)

**Timing**
- Phase 0–1: Minimal (setup phase)
- Phase 2–3: Land acquisition costs (negative cash flow)
- Phase 3+: Lease income begins
- Phase 6+: Spec home sales, rental income

---

### Sugar Mountain Builders

**Revenue Sources**
- Custom home builds
- Spec home development (JV or owned)
- Modular installs (Stax units)
- Remodels and additions
- Site work and development (for Valhalla)

**Timing**
- Phase 0: Early projects, building portfolio
- Phase 1: Growing revenue, establishing reputation
- Phase 2+: Steady growth, modular install revenue
- Phase 6+: Prototype village work, increased volume

**Cash Flow Considerations**
- Progress payments from clients
- Material deposits
- Subcontractor payments
- Retainage holdbacks
- Timing gaps between payments

---

### Grid Cabinet Systems

**Revenue Sources**
- External cabinet sales (builders, remodelers)
- Internal sales to Stax (transfer pricing)
- Internal sales to SMB (standard or discounted pricing)
- QuickBuild™ program (premium pricing potential)

**Timing**
- Phase 0–1: Launch, initial sales
- Phase 1+: Growing revenue, establishing customer base
- Phase 3+: Owned facility, increased capacity
- Ongoing: Steady revenue with growth

**Cash Flow Considerations**
- Material purchases (upfront)
- Labor costs (bi-weekly or monthly)
- Customer payments (net terms possible)
- Inventory investment (SSR)

---

### Stax Modular

**Revenue Sources**
- Module sales to homeowners (via SMB or direct)
- Module sales to builders
- Module sales to developers
- JV spec home modules (profit share)

**Timing**
- Phase 0–3: Design, planning, no revenue
- Phase 4: Prototype yard, first modules (low volume, higher cost)
- Phase 5: Full factory, scaling production
- Phase 6+: Prototype village, increased sales
- Phase 7+: Builder partnerships, volume sales

**Cash Flow Considerations**
- Large material purchases (upfront)
- Production labor (ongoing)
- Customer deposits (upfront)
- Progress payments (during production)
- Final payment (on delivery)
- Transport costs (timing)

4. Build scenario variations
5. Add sensitivity analysis
6. Create summary dashboards
7. Regular updates as actuals come in
