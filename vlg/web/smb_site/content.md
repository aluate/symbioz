## SECTION: Trust Bar (short)

**Heading:** Built for the way you actually live in the mountains.

**Blurb:**  

From snow loads to steep drives, frozen hose bibs to wildfire risk, Sugar Mountain Builders designs and builds homes that are beautiful, durable, and tuned to real mountain life—not just the brochure version.

## SECTION: Our Homes

**Heading:** Mountain-Modern, Inside and Out.

**Intro Paragraph:**  

We build homes that feel at home in the mountains: clean lines, warm materials, big glass, and thoughtful details. Whether it's a full custom home or a Sugar Mountain–designed spec, every project balances design, durability, and buildability.

**Subsections:**

### Custom & Semi-Custom Homes

We work with you from concept through completion—floor plans, specs, finishes, and construction. You get a single team managing the full build.

### Spec & Investment Homes

Sugar Mountain Builders also develops its own spec homes and joint-venture projects. These use proven floor plans, tight budgets, and reliable schedules to create value for investors and future owners.

## SECTION: Remodels & Additions

**Heading:** Make the Home You Have Feel Like the One You Want.

**Paragraph:**  

Kitchens, additions, whole-house refreshes, and "this place needs to actually work for us now" remodels. We bring the same planning and schedule discipline to remodels that we do to new construction.
