## SECTION: Problem / Solution

**Heading:** Cabinets Shouldn't Be the Reason a Job Slips.

**Paragraph:**  

Most cabinet delays aren't about craftsmanship—they're about chaos: too many options, long lead times, and unclear specs. Grid solves that with standardized SKUs, consistent materials, and a process built for schedules.

## SECTION: How It Works

**Heading:** From Order to Install, Simplified.

1. **Choose SKUs & Color** – Use our catalog to select sizes and SKUs.  

2. **Confirm Layout** – You send a layout or we help translate your plan into SKUs.  

3. **Production** – CNC, edgeband, and hardware within a tight schedule window.  

4. **Pickup or Delivery** – Flat-pack or assembled, depending on your needs.  

Note: Include mention of **Strategic Stock Reserve (SSR)** in a sidebar:  

> *We keep enough material on hand to build ~2 full kitchens at any time. That buffer is how we protect your schedule.*
