## SECTION: What Is Stax?

**Heading:** Not a Trailer. Not a Tiny Home. A Modern Modular System.

**Paragraph:**  

Stax builds real homes in modules: long, modern boxes with big glass and clean lines. Each module is engineered for transport and installation, then finished on a permanent foundation by a local GC like Sugar Mountain Builders.

## SECTION: Models

**Heading:** Stax Models (V1 Lineup Placeholder)

> NOTE for future Cursor work: flesh out each model in `catalogs/stax/stax_modules.md`.

**Example Subsections:**

### The Scout – Studio / ADU

A compact flat-roof studio with a full bath and efficient kitchen. Perfect as an ADU, guest house, or office.

### The Ridge – 1 Bedroom

A one-bedroom modern module with covered entry and generous glazing.

### The Summit – 2 Bedroom

Two-bedroom single-module home with open living area and full-size kitchen.

### Multi-Box Configs

Paired and stacked modules that form larger homes (2–3 boxes), using the same core modules.

## SECTION: How It Works

**Heading:** From Factory to Finished Home.

1. **Choose a Model & Options**  

   Pick a Stax model and choose your interior package (Quartz, Garnet, Sapphire spec tiers via Sugar Mountain).

2. **Site & Builder Coordination**  

   We work with Sugar Mountain Builders or your GC to confirm foundation, utilities, and access.

3. **Factory Build**  

   Modules are built in a controlled environment with Grid cabinets and pre-engineered details.

4. **Delivery & Set**  

   Modules are transported, craned into place, and weather-tight in days, not months.

5. **Finish & Move-In**  

   Your builder finishes decks, steps, site touches, and final inspections.
