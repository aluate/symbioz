# Forge Site – Brand Guide

## What Forge Site Is

Forge Site builds clean, modern websites for builders, trades, and shops.  
We work the way you work: direct, calm, and disciplined.  
No chaos. No art projects. No reinvention of the wheel.

We assemble sites from proven modules, shaped by intake data and guided by simple rules.
Every site is solid, clear, and easy to improve later.

Tagline: **Get seen. Stay simple.**

## Core Principles

### Clarity

Say things plainly.  
Show work honestly.  
Use layouts that make sense.

### Simplicity

Few decisions.  
Straight answers.  
Lean structure.

### Speed With Care

We move fast because the system is tight, not rushed.  
Production is predictable, and changes are light.

### Craft

Builders know the difference between rushed work and solid work.  
So do we.  
Modules are chosen on purpose.  
Copy is written with restraint.  
Layout is balanced and honest.

## Our Tone

Think work boots, not startup sneakers.

- Calm and direct  
- Short sentences  
- Concrete language  
- Minimal adjectives  
- Confident without hype  
- We talk like someone who's actually done the work  

If a sentence sounds like marketing fluff, cut it.

### Cadence

Keep lines tight.

Trim anything that feels extra.

Speak as if time matters.

## What We're Not

- Not an agency  
- Not a design playground  
- Not a place for unlimited revisions  
- Not here for noise or flash  

If someone wants something ornamental, we don't force it — but we don't chase it either.

## Internal Model (Factory)

Internally, yes, it's a factory:

- modules

- structured intake

- repeatable builds

- predictable delivery

Externally, we speak about:

- clarity

- clean builds

- simple structure

- solid results

The system matters.  
The metaphor should stay quiet.
